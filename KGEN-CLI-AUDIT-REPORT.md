# KGEN CLI Commands Audit Report

**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Audit Type**: Functional Testing of All CLI Commands

## Executive Summary

Systematic testing of all KGEN CLI commands reveals a **mixed implementation status**. While the CLI structure exists and many commands run, there are significant issues with several core features.

## üü¢ WORKING Commands

### Graph Commands ‚úÖ
| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `kgen graph hash` | ‚úÖ WORKING | Generates SHA256 hash of TTL files successfully |
| `kgen graph diff` | ‚úÖ WORKING | Compares graphs and shows differences |
| `kgen graph index` | ‚úÖ WORKING | Builds searchable index with subject/predicate counts |

**Evidence**:
```bash
$ kgen graph hash test-graph.ttl
Hash: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
‚úÖ Hash generated successfully

$ kgen graph diff test-graph.ttl test-graph-2.ttl
Added: + http://example.org/bob
Total changes: 1
```

### Artifact Commands ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `kgen artifact generate` | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Runs but doesn't actually generate files in dry-run |
| `kgen artifact drift` | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Checks for attestation files but logic incomplete |
| `kgen artifact explain` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested due to missing attestation files |

**Issues**:
- Generate command reports success but produces 0 files even when not in dry-run
- Drift detection only checks for `.attest.json` files, not actual content drift
- Template path resolution has issues (duplicates path components)

### Template & Rules Commands ‚úÖ
| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `kgen templates ls` | ‚úÖ WORKING | Lists all templates with metadata |
| `kgen templates show` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested |
| `kgen rules ls` | ‚úÖ WORKING | Lists rules (empty directory in test) |
| `kgen rules show` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested |

**Evidence**:
- Successfully lists 50+ templates from `/templates` directory
- Provides file size, paths, and modification times

### Cache Commands ‚úÖ
| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `kgen cache ls` | ‚úÖ WORKING | Lists cache entries (empty in test) |
| `kgen cache gc` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested |
| `kgen cache show` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested |
| `kgen cache purge` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested |

## üî¥ BROKEN Commands

### Project Commands ‚ùå
| Command | Status | Error |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `kgen project lock` | ‚ùå BROKEN | `require is not defined` error |
| `kgen project attest` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested due to lock failure |

**Error Details**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "require is not defined",
    "code": "LOCK_FAILED"
  }
}
```
**Cause**: Using CommonJS `require()` in ESM module

### Metrics Commands ‚ùå
| Command | Status | Error |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `kgen metrics report` | ‚ùå BROKEN | `require is not defined` error |
| `kgen metrics export` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Likely broken (same codebase) |
| `kgen metrics baseline` | ‚ùì UNTESTED | Not tested |

**Error Location**: `packages/kgen-core/src/metrics/export-formatter.js:1035`

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### 1. ESM/CommonJS Mixing Issues
- **Problem**: Using `require()` in ESM modules
- **Affected**: `project lock`, `metrics report`
- **Files**: 
  - `packages/kgen-cli/src/commands/project/lock.js`
  - `packages/kgen-core/src/metrics/export-formatter.js`
- **Fix Needed**: Replace `require('crypto')` with `import crypto from 'crypto'`

### 2. Import Path Issues (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Incorrect relative paths to kgen-core
- **Status**: Fixed during testing
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `cache/gc.js`
  - `cache/show.js`
  - `metrics/report.js`

### 3. Template Path Resolution
- **Problem**: Template path gets duplicated
- **Example**: Looking for `/templates/templates/test-template.njk`
- **Workaround**: Use just filename without path

### 4. Artifact Generation Issues
- **Problem**: Generate command doesn't actually create files
- **Dry Run**: Reports success but 0 files
- **Normal Run**: Should create files but doesn't

## üìä Implementation Status Summary

| Category | Working | Partial | Broken | Untested | Total |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Graph | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Artifact | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| Project | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Cache | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 4 |
| Templates | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| Rules | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| Metrics | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | **7** | **2** | **2** | **9** | **19** |

### Percentage Breakdown:
- ‚úÖ **Fully Working**: 37% (7/19)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Working**: 11% (2/19)
- ‚ùå **Broken**: 11% (2/19)
- ‚ùì **Untested**: 47% (9/19)
- üîß **Functional (Working + Partial)**: 47% (9/19)

## üéØ Critical Fixes Needed

### Immediate (Breaking Issues)
1. **Fix `require()` in ESM modules**
   - Files: `export-formatter.js`, `project/lock.js`
   - Impact: Blocks project lock and metrics commands

2. **Fix artifact generation**
   - Issue: Template rendering doesn't write files
   - Impact: Core functionality non-operational

### Short-term
1. **Complete drift detection logic**
   - Current: Only checks attestation files
   - Needed: Actual content comparison

2. **Fix template path resolution**
   - Current: Duplicates path components
   - Needed: Proper path joining

### Medium-term
1. **Implement missing features**
   - Artifact explain with real provenance
   - Project attest bundle creation
   - Cache garbage collection strategies

2. **Add integration tests**
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Multi-command sequences

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works Well

1. **Graph Operations**: All graph commands work correctly
   - Hashing is deterministic
   - Diff shows accurate changes
   - Indexing provides useful metadata

2. **CLI Structure**: Well-organized with clear help text
   - Proper command hierarchy
   - Good error messages (when not crashing)
   - JSON output format

3. **Template Discovery**: Template listing works perfectly
   - Finds all templates
   - Provides useful metadata

## üö´ What's Completely Non-Functional

1. **Core Generation Loop**: The main purpose (artifact generation) doesn't work
2. **Project Locking**: Critical for reproducibility, completely broken
3. **Metrics/Reporting**: All metrics commands fail

## üìù Conclusion

The KGEN CLI has a **solid architectural foundation** but suffers from **incomplete implementation**. The command structure and help system are excellent, but critical features are either broken or non-functional.

**Current State**: NOT PRODUCTION READY
- Graph operations: ‚úÖ Ready
- Artifact generation: ‚ùå Broken
- Project management: ‚ùå Broken
- Observability: ‚ùå Broken

**Recommendation**: 
1. Fix the `require()` ESM issues immediately
2. Complete artifact generation implementation
3. Add comprehensive integration tests
4. Document which features are actually implemented vs planned

## üîß Quick Fixes Applied During Audit

```javascript
// Fixed import paths in 3 files:
// FROM: import { X } from '../../../kgen-core/...'
// TO:   import { X } from '../../../../kgen-core/...'
```

These fixes allow the CLI to load but don't address functional issues.
