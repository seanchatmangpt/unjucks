**KGEN** is a deterministic, stateless command-line utility designed to function as a core compiler within an autonomous development swarm. It translates abstract knowledge models, represented as RDF graphs, into concrete, file-based artifacts such as source code, configuration, and documentation.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: Knowledge as Source

The knowledge graph is the single, canonical source of truth for a system's architecture and policies. All file artifacts are considered ephemeral, reproducible build products derived from that graph. This approach eliminates state drift, enables perfect auditability, and allows for high-speed, predictable system evolution driven by changes to the knowledge model.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔒 Deterministic Generation
- **Byte-for-byte identical outputs** for a given lockfile input, every time
- Hash-based content addressing for perfect reproducibility
- Eliminates stochasticity in artifact creation

### 🔍 State Drift Detection
- **100% detection** of unauthorized or out-of-process modifications
- Non-zero exit codes to reliably gate CI/CD pipelines
- Automatic drift correction capabilities

### 📋 Perfect Auditability
- **Cryptographically verifiable** link from any artifact back to its origin
- `.attest.json` sidecar files with canonical hashes
- Complete chain of custody tracking

### ⚡ Optimized Change Management
- **Precise impact analysis** of knowledge graph changes
- Low-cost calculation of affected file artifacts
- Graph diff capabilities without full regeneration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/unjucks.git
cd unjucks

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Link the CLI globally
npm link
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate artifacts from a knowledge graph
kgen artifact generate --graph knowledge.ttl --template api-service

# Check for state drift
kgen artifact drift --graph knowledge.ttl

# Create a deterministic lockfile
kgen project lock --graph knowledge.ttl

# Get graph hash for versioning
kgen graph hash knowledge.ttl
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

KGEN is built as a monorepo with the following structure:

```
kgen/
├── packages/
│   ├── kgen-cli/          # Command-line interface
│   ├── kgen-core/         # Core engine and libraries
│   ├── kgen-rules/        # N3.js rule packs
│   └── kgen-templates/    # Nunjucks template library
├── examples/              # Example projects
└── docs/                  # Documentation
```

### Core Components

- **RDF Processor**: N3.js-based graph processing
- **Template Engine**: Nunjucks with frontmatter support
- **Query Engine**: SPARQL with caching and optimization
- **Security Manager**: Encryption, signatures, and audit logging
- **Provenance System**: PROV-O compliant tracking
- **Validation Engine**: SHACL and custom rule validation

## 🔧 Configuration

KGEN uses a centralized configuration system via `kgen.config.js`:

```javascript
export default {
  project: {
    name: 'my-project',
    version: '1.0.0'
  },
  directories: {
    out: './dist/generated',
    templates: './templates',
    rules: './rules'
  },
  generate: {
    attestByDefault: true,
    globalVars: {
      companyName: 'ACME Corp'
    }
  },
  reasoning: {
    enabled: true,
    defaultRules: 'sox-compliance@1.2.0'
  }
}
```
