     ‚ùå Failed: 0
     üìã Total: 6
  üéâ All tests passed! Testing framework is working.
  ```

#### Standalone CLI Basic Operations (15/20)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL**
- **Help Command**: ‚úÖ Works perfectly - shows comprehensive CLI help
- **List Command**: ‚úÖ Works perfectly - shows 30 generators with template counts
- **Template Generation**: ‚úÖ Works - dry run successful for `component react TestComponent`
- **Binary Permissions**: ‚úÖ All executables have correct permissions

#### Template System (10/15)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FUNCTIONAL**
- **Template Discovery**: ‚úÖ Found 30 generators with 79+ total templates
- **Dry Run Generation**: ‚úÖ Successfully previews component creation
- **Template Structure**: ‚úÖ Well-organized template directory

### ‚ùå Broken Components (Major Issues - 65 points lost)

#### npm run build (0/25)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **COMPLETELY BROKEN**
- **Error**: `Cannot find module '/Users/sac/unjucks/src/lib/latex/build-integration.js'`
- **Root Cause**: Missing critical dependency file for LaTeX build integration
- **Impact**: Cannot build package, prevents publishing and production deployment

#### Main CLI Import System (0/20)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **BROKEN**
- **Error**: `Cannot find module '/Users/sac/unjucks/src/lib/fast-version-resolver.js'`
- **Impact**: Primary CLI entry point fails to import, main functionality inaccessible
- **Affected**: `node bin/unjucks.cjs` fails completely

#### Module Resolution (0/20)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL FAILURE**
- **Missing Files**:
  - `src/lib/fast-version-resolver.js`
  - `src/lib/latex/build-integration.js`
- **Impact**: Core CLI functionality broken, build system non-functional

## Comparison with Previous Commits

### vs 7b932ce "Making it work" (Score: 62/100)
- **Regression**: -17 points
- **Major Loss**: Working main CLI (was functional, now broken)
- **Similar Issues**: Both had build problems, but HEAD is worse

### vs 700cc1e "GitHub Actions Expert #2" (Score: 75/100)  
- **Regression**: -30 points
- **Significant Loss**: Build system was more stable
- **CLI Impact**: Main entry point was working better

### vs b8e6de0 "getting production ready" (Score: 78/100)
- **Major Regression**: -33 points
- **Critical Loss**: Production readiness completely lost
- **Irony**: Moved away from "production ready" state

## Critical Issues Analysis

### 1. Missing Dependencies (Critical)
```bash
# Missing files causing failures:
src/lib/fast-version-resolver.js     # Breaks main CLI
src/lib/latex/build-integration.js   # Breaks build system
```

### 2. Import Chain Failures
- Main CLI cannot start due to missing resolver
- Build system cannot complete due to missing LaTeX integration
- Core functionality inaccessible through primary entry points

### 3. Development vs Production Gap
- Tests pass (development environment works)
- Production builds fail (deployment impossible)
- User-facing CLI partially broken

## File Change Analysis

**Modified Files**: 2+ files in git status
- Indicates ongoing development work
- Suggests incomplete state/work in progress

## Recommendations for Recovery

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Restore Missing Files**:
   ```bash
   # Need to restore or create:
   src/lib/fast-version-resolver.js
   src/lib/latex/build-integration.js
   ```

2. **Fix Import Dependencies**:
   - Review and fix all import statements
   - Ensure module resolution paths are correct

3. **Validate Build System**:
   - Test `npm run build` after file restoration
   - Ensure build completes without errors

### Testing Protocol
1. Run `npm test` (should continue passing)
2. Test `npm run build` (currently fails)
3. Test `node bin/unjucks.cjs --help` (currently fails)
4. Test template generation end-to-end

## Scoring Breakdown

| Component | Max Points | Actual | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------|
| npm test | 10 | 10 | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| npm build | 25 | 0 | ‚ùå Broken |
| Main CLI | 20 | 0 | ‚ùå Broken |
| Standalone CLI | 20 | 15 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |
| Template System | 15 | 10 | ‚úÖ Working |
| Module Resolution | 10 | 0 | ‚ùå Broken |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | **35** | **‚ùå Failed** |

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH**
- Production deployment impossible
- Core functionality inaccessible
- User experience severely degraded
- Significant regression from previous working states

## Conclusion

The current HEAD commit represents a **significant regression** in functionality. While the underlying test infrastructure and template system remain intact, critical missing dependencies have broken the build system and main CLI entry point. 

**Immediate intervention required** to restore missing files and fix import resolution before any production deployment or user distribution.

**Priority**: Restore to at least 70+ score by fixing missing dependencies and import chains.
