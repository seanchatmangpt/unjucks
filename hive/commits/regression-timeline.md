# Regression Timeline Analysis

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The CLI has been fundamentally broken across ALL examined commits due to missing core files. What appeared to be "working" states were actually never functional.

## Commit Analysis

### Commit b8e6de0 (2025-09-08): "getting production ready"
- **Status**: Production claims but CLI broken
- **Issues**: 
  - Imports non-existent `src/lib/generator.js`
  - CLI completely non-functional
  - False production readiness claims

### Commit 91fac78 (2025-09-08): "Fix critical production issues: template discovery and dependency resolution"
- **Status**: Claims to fix production issues but CLI still broken
- **Issues**:
  - Same missing `src/lib/generator.js` import
  - CLI throws MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
  - Commit message claims "CLI functionality restored" - **FALSE**
  - Claims "list, generate, and help commands working" - **FALSE**

### Commit 7b932ce (HEAD): "Making it work"
- **Status**: Latest attempt, still broken
- **Issues**:
  - Identical CLI breakage
  - 302 files added but core CLI still non-functional
  - Massive scope creep with Docker, compliance, monitoring

## Regression Analysis

### What "Worked" vs What Actually Worked

**FALSE CLAIMS IN COMMITS**:
- 91fac78 claimed "CLI functionality restored" - **LIE**
- 91fac78 claimed "list, generate, and help commands working" - **LIE**  
- 91fac78 claimed "Test suite passing with basic validations" - **LIKELY FALSE**

### Core Issues Across All Commits

1. **Missing Generator Module**: `src/lib/generator.js` never existed
2. **Broken Import Chain**: `src/index.js` imports non-existent files
3. **False Success Reports**: Commit messages claim functionality that doesn't work
4. **No Real Testing**: If tests were run, they would have caught this immediately

## Specific Regressions

### Between b8e6de0 and 91fac78
- **No CLI improvement**: Both commits have identical CLI breakage
- **Added complexity**: More Docker/enterprise files but no core fixes
- **False progress**: Commit claims fixes that don't exist

### Between 91fac78 and 7b932ce  
- **No CLI improvement**: Still broken with same error
- **Massive scope creep**: Added 302 files for enterprise features
- **Lost focus**: Infrastructure over core functionality

## Timeline of Dysfunction

```
b8e6de0 ──► 91fac78 ──► 7b932ce (HEAD)
   ❌          ❌           ❌
  Broken     "Fixed"     "Working"
            (Still       (Still
             Broken)      Broken)
```

## Critical Missing Files

1. `src/lib/generator.js` - Core generator class
2. `src/lib/template-scanner.js` - Template discovery 
3. `src/lib/file-injector.js` - File manipulation
4. `src/lib/prompts.js` - User interaction

## Testing Results

```bash
# Test performed on all commits
$ node src/index.js list

Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/Users/sac/unjucks/src/lib/generator.js'
```

**RESULT**: Identical failure across all commits.

## Recommendations

1. **STOP claiming fixes work** - Verify with actual testing
2. **Create missing files** - Build the actual implementation
3. **Focus on core functionality** - Skip enterprise features until CLI works
4. **Add real tests** - Catch these issues before commits
5. **Truth in commit messages** - Don't claim functionality that doesn't exist

## Conclusion

**NO FUNCTIONALITY WAS LOST** because **NO FUNCTIONALITY EVER EXISTED**. This is not a regression but a persistent failure to implement basic CLI functionality while claiming enterprise readiness.

The project has been in a broken state across all examined commits, with increasingly grandiose claims about functionality that has never worked.
