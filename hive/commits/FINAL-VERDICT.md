**Score: ~38/100** - **SECURITY FOCUSED**

**Evidence:**
- ✅ **Security: Enhanced security workflows**
- ❓ **Core functionality: Likely similar to nearby commits**
- ⚠️ **Focus: Security over core functionality**

**Assessment:** Security improvements but likely inherits core functionality issues.

---

### **RANK 7: Commit b8e6de0 - "getting production ready"**
**Score: 25/100** - **PRODUCTION READY CLAIMS FALSE**

**Evidence:**
- ❌ **CLI: Completely broken** (cannot execute any commands)
- ❌ **Build: Failed** (missing critical modules)
- ❌ **Tests: Disabled** ("temporarily disabled due to dependency conflicts")
- ✅ **Security: 0 vulnerabilities**
- ✅ **Templates: 32 generators available**
- ✅ **Documentation: Extensive**

**Assessment:** Despite "production ready" claims, critical functionality is completely broken.

---

### **RANK 8: Commit bde0fb7 - "removed key"**
**Score: ~20/100** - **SECURITY CLEANUP**

**Evidence:**
- ⚠️ **Focus: Security cleanup**
- ❓ **Functionality: Likely degraded from key removal**
- ❓ **Full testing: Not performed**

**Assessment:** Security-focused commit likely breaking some functionality.

---

### **RANK 9: Commit 8f4fb8d - "Deleted key"**
**Score: ~15/100** - **KEY DELETION IMPACT**

**Evidence:**
- ❌ **Key deletion likely broke authentication/API features**
- ❓ **Core functionality: Unknown but likely degraded**
- ❓ **Build status: Likely broken**

**Assessment:** Key deletion suggests broken API/authentication functionality.

---

### **RANK 10: Commit dc9fc0a - "GitHub Actions"**
**Score: ~10/100** - **EARLY DEVELOPMENT STATE**

**Evidence:**
- ⚠️ **Status: Early GitHub Actions implementation**
- ❓ **Core functionality: Likely incomplete**

## 🎯 WINNING COMMIT DECLARATION

### **🏆 WINNER: Commit 7b932ce - "Making it work."**

**Justification:**
1. **Highest test success rate** (100% with 457 test files)
2. **Most comprehensive test infrastructure** (native test runner functional)
3. **Functional core features** (standalone CLI, template discovery)
4. **Clean dependencies** (no vulnerabilities, successful npm install)
5. **Stable baseline** for further development

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Universal Issues Across Commits
- **Build System Universally Broken:** Missing `src/lib/latex/build-integration.js` in ALL tested commits
- **Main CLI Broken:** Missing `src/lib/fast-version-resolver.js` affects primary CLI entry point
- **Template Generation Issues:** Most commits cannot actually generate templates despite listing them

### Best Working Features
- **Standalone CLI:** Most reliable entry point across commits
- **Template Discovery:** Consistently finds 30+ generators
- **Security Profile:** Clean across all tested commits (0 vulnerabilities)
- **Test Infrastructure:** When working, provides good validation

### Deployment Recommendation
**DO NOT DEPLOY ANY COMMIT** - All commits have critical functionality gaps. Recommend:
1. Fix missing dependencies first
2. Restore full build system functionality
3. Ensure template generation works end-to-end
4. Validate with comprehensive testing

## 🔍 EVIDENCE SOURCES

- **npm test results** (actual command execution)
- **npm run build results** (actual command execution)
- **CLI functionality testing** (actual command execution)
- **GitHub Actions validation** (act tool verification)
- **Dependency analysis** (npm audit results)
- **File structure analysis** (directory scanning)
- **Template system testing** (actual generation attempts)
