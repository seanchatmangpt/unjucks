## Best Performing Commit: f32b33d Analysis

### What Actually Works:
- ✅ Standalone CLI (`unjucks-standalone.cjs`) functional
- ✅ Template discovery (30 generators found)
- ✅ Dry run generation for templates
- ✅ Version and help commands
- ✅ Dependency installation succeeds

### Critical Failures:
- ❌ Main CLI broken (missing fast-version-resolver.js)
- ❌ Build system broken (missing build-integration.js)
- ❌ Tests disabled ("dependency conflicts")
- ❌ GitHub Actions invalid YAML syntax

## Common Critical Issues Across All Commits

### 1. Missing Core Dependencies (100% of commits)
- `citty` package missing despite being imported
- `fast-version-resolver.js` missing
- `latex/build-integration.js` missing

### 2. CLI Failures (100% of commits)
Every single commit has broken CLI functionality due to:
```javascript
Error: Cannot find module 'citty'
Error: Cannot find module '/src/lib/fast-version-resolver.js'
```

### 3. Test Infrastructure Broken (100% of commits)
- Tests disabled with "dependency conflicts" message
- vitest command not found
- No functional validation possible

### 4. GitHub Actions Invalid (100% of commits)
- YAML syntax errors in deployment.yml
- Invalid container environment variable references
- `act --list` fails on all workflows

## Regression Analysis

### Commits 1-10 vs 11-20 Comparison

| Metric | Commits 1-10 | Commits 11-20 | Change |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Best Score | 62/100 (7b932ce) | 45/100 (f32b33d) | **-27%** |
| Average Score | ~35/100 | ~18/100 | **-49%** |
| Working CLI | Standalone works | Mostly broken | **Worse** |
| Tests Running | 6 tests pass | 0 tests run | **-100%** |
| Build System | Partial | Completely broken | **Worse** |

## Critical Discovery: LaTeX Integration Destroyed Functionality

Commits 13f6fe5 through cc055b6 all claim LaTeX integration progress but:
1. **No actual LaTeX implementation found** in any commit
2. **Each LaTeX commit breaks more functionality**
3. **bc39976 "Adding latex"** scores lowest at 5/100
4. **39,913 lines added** but none verifiable due to broken environment

## The Truth About These Commits

### False Claims vs Reality:
- **"Almost done"** (7dfdb43) → 15/100 functionality
- **"Finishined latex?"** (717e476) → No LaTeX found, CLI broken
- **"Close to done with latex"** (13f6fe5) → No LaTeX exists
- **"Working on actions"** (f32b33d) → Actions have syntax errors

## Recommendations

### For Production Use:
**DO NOT USE ANY COMMIT FROM 11-20**

### If Forced to Choose:
1. **Use f32b33d** with understanding that:
   - Only standalone CLI works
   - Cannot build project
   - Cannot run tests
   - GitHub Actions don't work

2. **Alternative**: Go back further in history (before commit 11) to find working version

### Immediate Fixes Required:
1. Install missing `citty` dependency
2. Create missing `fast-version-resolver.js`
3. Create missing `latex/build-integration.js`
4. Fix GitHub Actions YAML syntax
5. Re-enable test suite

## Conclusion

Commits 11-20 represent a **development disaster** where attempted feature additions (LaTeX, GitHub Actions) systematically destroyed existing functionality. The best commit (f32b33d) is only 45% functional and unsuitable for production.

**Verdict**: These commits demonstrate what happens when development proceeds without testing. Every commit made bold claims ("Almost done", "Finishing") while actual functionality declined from already-broken states.
