# Quick Fixes Applied - Unjucks Template Generator

## Summary
These are minimal changes applied to restore core template generator functionality without major refactoring.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Missing Files
- `src/lib/version-resolver.js` - Simple version resolution utility
- `bin/unjucks.cjs` - CLI entry point binary
- `src/cli/index.js` - Simplified CLI implementation with inline commands
- `src/lib/generator.js` - JavaScript version of Generator class (converted from TypeScript)

### 2. Fixed Import Issues
- Removed broken chalk imports and created fallback implementations
- Fixed async/await syntax errors in CLI
- Simplified command imports to avoid circular dependencies
- Converted TypeScript syntax to plain JavaScript where needed

### 3. CLI Functionality Restored
- Basic CLI commands working: `--help`, `help`, `list`
- Bin path correctly configured and executable
- Error handling for missing dependencies
- Fallback implementations for missing modules

## Verification

The following commands now work:
```bash
node bin/unjucks.cjs --help    # Shows help
node bin/unjucks.cjs help      # Shows template help
node bin/unjucks.cjs list      # Lists generators (shows error for missing libs but doesn't crash)
```

## Status: FUNCTIONAL BASELINE RESTORED âœ…

The template generator now has basic CLI functionality working. While some dependencies are still missing (like proper template scanning, frontmatter parsing), the core CLI framework is functional and won't crash on basic operations.

## Next Steps (Not Done - Out of Scope)
- Fix remaining missing dependencies (TemplateScanner, FrontmatterParser, etc.)
- Convert all TypeScript files to JavaScript or set up proper TypeScript compilation
- Fix package.json scripts and build process
- Add proper error handling for file operations
- Implement missing RDF/Turtle functionality

## Files Modified
- `/bin/unjucks.cjs` - Created
- `/src/cli/index.js` - Created (simplified)
- `/src/lib/version-resolver.js` - Created  
- `/src/lib/generator.js` - Created (JS version)
