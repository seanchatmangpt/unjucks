## London School TDD Example

Created comprehensive example (`london-school-tdd-example.test.js`) demonstrating:

### Outside-In Development
- **Behavior verification** over state inspection
- **Mock-driven design** with clear contracts
- **Interaction testing** focusing on object collaboration
- **Workflow orchestration** testing

### Key Patterns Demonstrated
1. **Collaboration verification** - Testing how objects work together
2. **Sequence verification** - Ensuring correct order of operations
3. **Error handling** - Proper failure modes and notifications
4. **Async coordination** - Concurrent operations and timeout handling
5. **Property-based validation** - Invariant checking across inputs

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Flaky Test Elimination
- **Deterministic timeouts** with proper error handling
- **Retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff
- **Resource isolation** preventing test interference
- **Proper cleanup** preventing state leakage

### 2. Improved Reliability
- **Circuit breaker patterns** preventing cascade failures
- **Async operation management** with proper timeout handling
- **Resource pooling** with concurrency limits
- **Error recovery** strategies for transient failures

### 3. Better Test Organization
- **Shared fixtures** reducing test setup overhead
- **Cross-test communication** for complex scenarios
- **Environment isolation** preventing conflicts
- **Comprehensive statistics** for performance analysis

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- **Detailed mock interaction tracking** with sequence numbers
- **Performance metrics** collection and analysis
- **Error categorization** for better troubleshooting
- **Comprehensive logging** with coordination hooks

## Integration with Claude Flow

All helpers integrate with Claude Flow coordination system:
- **Pre/post task hooks** for test lifecycle management
- **Memory storage** for cross-test data sharing
- **Performance tracking** with automated metrics
- **Session management** for test coordination

## Usage Examples

### Basic Property Testing
```javascript
const propertyHelper = new PropertyTestHelper();
await propertyHelper.runProperty(
  async (input) => /* test property */,
  require('fast-check').record({ /* arbitraries */ }),
  { numRuns: 100 }
);
```

### Async Operation Testing
```javascript
const asyncHelper = new AsyncTestHelper();
const result = await asyncHelper.withTimeout(
  () => /* async operation */,
  5000,
  'operation-name'
);
```

### Environment Management
```javascript
const envId = await createTestEnvironment('test-name');
const { testHelper, fileHelper } = getTestHelpers(envId);
// ... use helpers
await cleanupTestEnvironment(envId);
```

### Mock Behavior Verification
```javascript
const mock = createMock('ServiceName', { method: { returnValue: 'result' } });
expect('ServiceName', 'method').toBeCalledWith('arg').toBeCalledTimes(1);
// ... execute code
verifyAll();
```
