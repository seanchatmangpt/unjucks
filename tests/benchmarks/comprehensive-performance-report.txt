Critical Bottlenecks:

  Slowest Operations:
    1. JSON Parse/Stringify (1,000 cycles): 76.91ms (2.9MB)
       → Optimize string operations, avoid repeated concatenation
    2. Node.js Startup Time: 55.92ms (0.2MB)
       → Profile specific operations for micro-optimizations
    3. Mathematical Computation (1M operations): 20.98ms (-2.19MB)
       → Consider worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
    4. Large Array Operations (100,000 elements): 6.07ms (1.94MB)
       → Use streaming for large arrays, process in chunks
    5. Promise.all with Mixed Operations (50 ops): 6.01ms (1.9MB)
       → Profile specific operations for micro-optimizations

  Memory Intensive Operations:
    1. JSON Parse/Stringify (1,000 cycles): 2.9MB (76.91ms)
       → Monitor for memory leaks and implement cleanup
    2. Large Array Operations (100,000 elements): 1.94MB (6.07ms)
       → Monitor for memory leaks and implement cleanup
    3. Small Object Creation (10,000 objects): 1.91MB (3.04ms)
       → Monitor for memory leaks and implement cleanup
    4. Promise.all with Mixed Operations (50 ops): 1.9MB (6.01ms)
       → Monitor for memory leaks and implement cleanup

Optimization Recommendations:
1. Focus on slowest operations for immediate impact
2. Implement parallel processing where applicable  
3. Use streaming for large data operations
4. Consider worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
5. Monitor memory usage and implement cleanup procedures
6. Profile specific implementations for micro-optimizations
