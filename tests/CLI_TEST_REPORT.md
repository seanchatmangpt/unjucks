# CLI Test Results Report

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive testing of the Unjucks CLI following TypeScript conversion, **most commands work individually but the main CLI has critical integration issues**. The file writing functionality is broken despite success reporting.

## ‚úÖ WORKING FUNCTIONALITY

### Basic Commands
- `--version` / `-v` - Shows version correctly
- `--help` / `-h` - Displays comprehensive help menu
- Default behavior - Shows usage when no command given

### Template Discovery  
- `list` - Shows error about no generators (expected behavior)
- `list --help` - Shows all options with detailed descriptions
- `help` - Shows general help with generator examples
- `help <generator>` - Shows generator-specific help

### Generation (Partial)
- `generate --help` - Shows all generation options
- `generate --dry` - Shows preview of files to be generated
- Template variable processing - Works correctly
- Verbose mode - Shows detailed processing steps

### Command Imports
- All individual commands import successfully when tested in isolation
- File injector module imports without errors  
- TypeScript interfaces are available

## ‚ùå BROKEN FUNCTIONALITY

### Critical Issues

#### 1. File Writing (CRITICAL)
- Generation reports success but **files are not written to disk**
- Affects all actual code generation functionality
- Dry run works, but actual writing fails silently

#### 2. CLI Integration (CRITICAL) 
- Original `src/cli.js` and `src/cli/index.js` have import/export mismatches
- Some commands export as default, others as named exports
- CLI attempts to import all as named exports, causing failures

#### 3. Module Loading Issues
- When all commands are loaded together in CLI, conflicts occur
- Individual command testing works, but integrated CLI fails

## üìä Command Status Matrix

| Command | Import | Help | Dry Run | Actual Execution |
|---------|--------|------|---------|------------------|
| version | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | N/A | ‚úÖ |
| help | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | N/A | ‚úÖ |
| list | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | N/A | ‚úÖ |
| generate | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| inject | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå |
| migrate | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå |
| semantic | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå |
| workflow | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå |
| github | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå |

**Legend:** ‚úÖ Works | ‚ùå Broken | ‚ö†Ô∏è Untested due to file writing issues

## üîß Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Export/Import Mismatch
```javascript
// CLI tries to import:
import { workflowCommand } from '../commands/workflow.js';

// But workflow.js exports:
export default workflowCommand;
```

### Secondary Issue: File Writing Logic
- Generation process successfully:
  - Discovers templates ‚úÖ
  - Processes variables ‚úÖ  
  - Renders content ‚úÖ
  - Reports success ‚úÖ
- But fails to write files to disk ‚ùå

### Tertiary Issue: Complex Integration
- Commands work individually
- Fail when integrated into main CLI
- Dependency conflicts when loading all together

## üö® Impact Assessment

### High Impact
- **Code generation is non-functional** - Core feature broken
- **CLI is unusable** in production - Import errors prevent startup
- **Template development workflow** disrupted

### Medium Impact  
- Help and discovery systems work - Users can see what's available
- Dry run functionality works - Users can preview generation
- Individual command testing possible for development

### Low Impact
- Documentation and help text display correctly
- Error messages are informative
- Command structure is sound

## üìã Immediate Action Required

### Priority 1: Fix File Writing
1. Debug why files aren't written despite success reporting
2. Test file system permissions and paths
3. Verify template rendering output reaches file system

### Priority 2: Fix Import/Export Consistency  
1. Standardize all commands to use named exports
2. Update CLI to import consistently
3. Test integrated CLI startup

### Priority 3: Integration Testing
1. Test all commands together in integrated CLI
2. Verify no module loading conflicts
3. Ensure all functionality works end-to-end

## üéØ Testing Coverage

- **Basic CLI operations: 100% tested**
- **Template discovery: 100% tested** 
- **Generation preview: 100% tested**
- **Actual file generation: 0% working**
- **Advanced features: 0% tested** (blocked by file writing)

## üí° Recommendations

### For Development
1. Use dry-run mode for testing until file writing is fixed
2. Test commands individually rather than through main CLI
3. Focus on fixing the file writing logic first

### For Users
1. CLI is currently unsuitable for production use
2. Template structure and discovery systems are reliable
3. Wait for file writing fix before using for actual generation
