@mcp @protocol @compliance @critical
Feature: MCP Protocol Compliance
  As a system integrator
  I want to ensure full MCP protocol compliance
  So that the swarm can integrate with any MCP-compatible system

  Background:
    Given the MCP server is running on a standard port
    And the server supports MCP specification version "2024-11-05"

  @protocol @initialization
  Scenario: MCP server initialization
    When I connect to the MCP server
    Then I should receive a server info response
    And the response should contain:
      | field       | expected_type | required |
      | name        | string        | true     |
      | version     | string        | true     |
      | description | string        | false    |
      | author      | object        | false    |
    And server capabilities should be declared:
      | capability | supported |
      | tools      | true      |
      | resources  | false     |
      | prompts    | false     |
      | logging    | true      |

  @protocol @jsonrpc
  Scenario Outline: JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
    Given I send a <message_type> with <properties>
    Then the response should be valid JSON-RPC 2.0
    And should contain required fields: <required_fields>
    And should not contain invalid fields

    Examples:
      | message_type | properties                           | required_fields        |
      | request      | id, method, params                   | jsonrpc, id           |
      | notification | method, params                       | jsonrpc               |
      | response     | id, result                          | jsonrpc, id, result   |
      | error        | id, error.code, error.message       | jsonrpc, id, error    |

  @protocol @tools-list
  Scenario: List available tools
    When I send a "tools/list" request
    Then I should receive all registered swarm tools:
      | tool_name                    | description                           |
      | unjucks_list                | List available generators             |
      | unjucks_generate            | Generate files from templates         |
      | unjucks_help                | Get help for templates               |
      | unjucks_dry_run             | Preview generation without writing    |
      | unjucks_inject              | Inject content into existing files   |
      | unjucks_enterprise_auth     | Enterprise authentication            |
      | unjucks_template_marketplace| Template marketplace operations      |
      | unjucks_realtime_collab     | Real-time collaboration              |
      | unjucks_e2e_swarm          | E2E swarm orchestration              |
    And each tool should have complete schema definition
    And schema should validate against JSON Schema Draft 7

  @protocol @tool-execution
  Scenario: Tool execution compliance
    Given I have a valid tool "unjucks_e2e_swarm"
    When I send a "tools/call" request with:
      | parameter | value           |
      | name      | unjucks_e2e_swarm |
      | arguments | {"action": "initialize", "topology": "mesh", "agentCount": 3} |
    Then the response should be a valid ToolResult
    And should contain:
      | field    | type    | required |
      | content  | array   | true     |
      | isError  | boolean | false    |
      | _meta    | object  | false    |
    And content array should contain TextContent or ImageContent objects
    And if isError is true, error details should be in content

  @protocol @error-handling
  Scenario Outline: MCP error code compliance
    When I send an invalid request: <invalid_request>
    Then I should receive error code <error_code>
    And error message should be descriptive
    And should follow MCP error format

    Examples:
      | invalid_request           | error_code |
      | malformed JSON           | -32700     |
      | missing jsonrpc field    | -32600     |
      | unknown method           | -32601     |
      | invalid parameters       | -32602     |
      | internal server error    | -32603     |
      | tool not found          | -32000     |
      | tool execution failed   | -32000     |

  @protocol @message-format
  Scenario: Message format validation
    Given I send messages with various formats
    When message has jsonrpc field with value "2.0"
    Then message should be processed
    When message has jsonrpc field with value "1.0"
    Then I should receive error -32600
    When message is missing required id field
    Then request should be treated as notification
    When notification includes id field
    Then id should be ignored

  @protocol @parameter-validation
  Scenario: Parameter validation
    Given tool "unjucks_e2e_swarm" with schema
    When I call tool with valid parameters:
      ```json
      {
        "action": "initialize",
        "topology": "mesh",
        "agentCount": 5
      }
      ```
    Then parameter validation should pass
    When I call tool with invalid parameters:
      ```json
      {
        "action": "invalid_action",
        "topology": "unknown",
        "agentCount": "not_a_number"
      }
      ```
    Then I should receive validation error
    And error should specify which parameters are invalid

  @protocol @streaming
  Scenario: Streaming response compliance
    Given I execute a long-running swarm task
    When task produces intermediate results
    Then server should send progress notifications
    And each notification should be valid MCP format
    And final response should contain complete results
    And streaming should be optional based on client capabilities

  @protocol @concurrency
  Scenario: Concurrent request handling
    When I send multiple concurrent requests:
      | request_id | method      | expected_response_time |
      | req-001    | tools/list  | <500ms                 |
      | req-002    | tools/call  | <5000ms                |
      | req-003    | tools/call  | <5000ms                |
      | req-004    | tools/list  | <500ms                 |
    Then all requests should be processed
    And responses should match request IDs
    And no request should block others
    And resource usage should remain stable

  @protocol @security
  Scenario: Protocol-level security
    Given MCP server is configured for security
    When I attempt to send oversized message (>10MB)
    Then connection should be rejected
    When I send rapid-fire requests (>1000/second)
    Then rate limiting should apply
    When I send malicious payloads:
      | payload_type        | expected_behavior    |
      | Script injection    | Sanitized/rejected   |
      | Buffer overflow     | Connection closed    |
      | Infinite recursion  | Request timeout      |
      | Memory exhaustion   | Resource limits      |
    Then server should remain stable
    And security events should be logged

  @protocol @versioning
  Scenario: Protocol version negotiation
    Given server supports MCP version "2024-11-05"
    When client requests compatible version
    Then communication should proceed normally
    When client requests unsupported version
    Then server should return version mismatch error
    And should indicate supported versions
    
  @protocol @transport
  Scenario: Transport layer independence
    Given MCP server supports multiple transports
    When I connect via stdio transport
    Then all MCP features should work
    When I connect via HTTP SSE transport  
    Then all MCP features should work
    When I connect via WebSocket transport
    Then all MCP features should work
    And real-time features should be enhanced

  @protocol @logging
  Scenario: MCP logging compliance
    Given logging is enabled
    When I execute various MCP operations
    Then log messages should follow MCP logging format:
      | field     | type   | required |
      | level     | string | true     |
      | data      | any    | false    |
      | logger    | string | false    |
    And log levels should be standard: error, warn, info, debug
    And logs should be structured JSON
    And sensitive data should be redacted

  @protocol @resource-management
  Scenario: Resource lifecycle management
    Given MCP server manages resources
    When resources are created during operations
    Then resources should have unique identifiers
    And resource URIs should follow RFC 3986
    And resources should support CRUD operations
    When resources are no longer needed
    Then cleanup should be automatic
    And no resource leaks should occur

  @protocol @metadata
  Scenario: Metadata handling
    Given tools support metadata
    When I execute tools with metadata
    Then metadata should be preserved in responses
    And should not affect tool execution
    And should be available for debugging
    And should support custom fields
    
  @protocol @batch-operations
  Scenario: Batch request processing
    When I send batch request with multiple operations:
      ```json
      [
        {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"},
        {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "unjucks_list"}},
        {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "unjucks_help"}}
      ]
      ```
    Then I should receive batch response
    And responses should be in array format
    And each response should match request ID
    And partial failures should not affect other operations

  @protocol @timeout-handling
  Scenario: Request timeout compliance
    Given server has configurable timeouts
    When I send request with expected duration 30s
    And timeout is set to 60s
    Then request should complete normally
    When timeout is set to 10s
    Then I should receive timeout error -32000
    And partial results should be returned if available
    And server resources should be cleaned up
