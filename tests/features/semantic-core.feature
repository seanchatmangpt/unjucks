Feature: 80/20 Semantic Core - Critical Enterprise Scenarios
  As an enterprise developer working with semantic data
  I want to process healthcare FHIR, financial FIBO, and supply chain GS1 data
  So that I can generate compliant code with 80% semantic value coverage

  Background:
    Given I have MCP swarm coordination initialized
    And I have real semantic data processing capabilities
    And I have performance monitoring enabled for enterprise scale

  # CRITICAL SCENARIO 1: Healthcare FHIR (35% of semantic value)
  Scenario: Process FHIR R4 patient data with PHI protection and compliance
    Given I have anonymized FHIR R4 patient records in RDF/Turtle format
    And the data includes patient demographics, conditions, and medications
    And PHI protection filters are enabled
    When I process the FHIR data through semantic templates
    Then the system should validate FHIR R4 compliance
    And PHI data should be properly anonymized or masked
    And generated code should include HIPAA-compliant data handling
    And semantic validation should confirm correct FHIR vocabulary usage
    And performance should handle 10,000+ patient records under 5 seconds
    And memory usage should stay under 256MB during processing
    Examples:
      | patient_count | max_time | max_memory | compliance_level |
      | 1000         | 2s       | 128MB      | HIPAA            |
      | 10000        | 5s       | 256MB      | HIPAA            |
      | 50000        | 15s      | 512MB      | HIPAA            |

  # CRITICAL SCENARIO 2: Financial FIBO with Basel III (30% of semantic value)
  Scenario: Process FIBO financial instruments with Basel III risk calculations
    Given I have FIBO ontology financial instrument definitions
    And the data includes derivatives, bonds, and risk parameters
    And Basel III regulatory requirements are configured
    When I process the financial data through risk calculation templates
    Then the system should validate FIBO ontology compliance
    And risk calculations should follow Basel III standards
    And generated code should include regulatory reporting capabilities
    And semantic validation should confirm correct FIBO vocabulary usage
    And performance should process complex instruments under 3 seconds
    And calculations should maintain precision for regulatory accuracy
    Examples:
      | instrument_type | complexity | max_time | precision_digits | regulation |
      | derivative      | high       | 3s       | 8                | Basel III  |
      | bond           | medium     | 1s       | 6                | Basel III  |
      | equity         | low        | 0.5s     | 4                | Basel III  |

  # CRITICAL SCENARIO 3: Supply Chain GS1 with Blockchain (15% of semantic value)
  Scenario: Process GS1 product catalog with traceability and anti-counterfeiting
    Given I have GS1 product catalog data with GTIN, GLN, and SSCC identifiers
    And the data includes blockchain hashes for product authenticity
    And traceability requirements are configured for pharmaceutical products
    When I process the supply chain data through traceability templates
    Then the system should validate GS1 standards compliance
    And blockchain integration should verify product authenticity
    And generated code should include anti-counterfeiting measures
    And semantic validation should confirm correct GS1 vocabulary usage
    And performance should track 100,000+ products under 10 seconds
    And traceability chains should be cryptographically verifiable
    Examples:
      | product_category | chain_length | max_time | security_level | blockchain_type |
      | pharmaceutical  | 10           | 10s      | high           | ethereum        |
      | food           | 5            | 5s       | medium         | hyperledger     |
      | electronics    | 15           | 15s      | high           | bitcoin         |

  # CROSS-SCENARIO INTEGRATION (20% additional value)
  Scenario: Integrate healthcare, financial, and supply chain data
    Given I have patient treatment data that references pharmaceutical products
    And pharmaceutical products have financial risk and supply chain data
    And all data uses linked semantic vocabularies
    When I process the integrated semantic graph
    Then cross-domain relationships should be preserved
    And generated code should handle multi-domain complexity
    And semantic consistency should be validated across all domains
    And performance should maintain sub-linear scaling
    And compliance should be enforced for all applicable regulations

  # PERFORMANCE VALIDATION (Enterprise Scale)
  Scenario: Validate enterprise-scale performance with 100K+ triples
    Given I have a semantic dataset with over 100,000 triples
    And the dataset includes healthcare, financial, and supply chain data
    And MCP swarm coordination is optimized for large datasets
    When I process the complete dataset through semantic templates
    Then processing should complete within 30 seconds
    And memory usage should not exceed 1GB
    And generated templates should maintain quality at scale
    And semantic queries should remain responsive
    And MCP coordination should handle parallel processing efficiently

  # COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY VALIDATION
  Scenario: Validate comprehensive compliance and security measures
    Given I have semantic data subject to HIPAA, SOX, and FDA regulations

    When I process the data through security-aware templates
    Then HIPAA compliance should be validated for healthcare data
    And SOX compliance should be enforced for financial data
    And FDA traceability requirements should be met for pharmaceutical data
    And generated code should include audit trails
    And security vulnerabilities should be automatically detected
    And compliance reports should be generated automatically

    And coordination overhead should be minimal

  # ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY
  Scenario: Handle semantic data errors and recovery scenarios
    Given I have semantic data with various error conditions
    And recovery mechanisms are configured for each error type
    When I encounter invalid RDF syntax, missing vocabularies, or compliance violations
    Then the system should handle invalid RDF gracefully
    And missing vocabularies should trigger appropriate fallbacks
    And compliance violations should be logged and reported
    And processing should continue with valid data portions
    And recovery should maintain data integrity and auditability
