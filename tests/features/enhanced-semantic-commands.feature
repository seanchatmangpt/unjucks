Feature: Enhanced Semantic Command Validation with MCP Integration
  As a developer using Unjucks with enhanced semantic capabilities
  I want comprehensive validation of semantic RDF processing and swarm orchestration
  So that I can confidently use advanced semantic features in production

  Background:
    Given the Unjucks CLI is available
    And MCP server is running and accessible
    And semantic engine is initialized with RDF capabilities
    And claude-flow MCP tools are available

  @semantic-analysis @critical
  Scenario: Enhanced RDF analysis with neural pattern recognition
    Given I have an RDF file with complex semantic relationships at "tests/fixtures/semantic/complex-ontology.ttl"
    And the semantic engine has neural pattern recognition enabled
    When I run "unjucks semantic analyze tests/fixtures/semantic/complex-ontology.ttl --neural --output-format json"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain valid RDF analysis JSON
    And the analysis should include neural pattern insights
    And cognitive patterns should be identified for optimization
    And the response time should be under 5 seconds
    And memory usage should not exceed 512MB

  @semantic-swarm @integration
  Scenario: Semantic analysis with swarm coordination
    Given I initialize a semantic processing swarm with "unjucks swarm init --topology mesh --agents 5 --neural"
    And I have multiple RDF files in "tests/fixtures/semantic/"
    When I run "unjucks semantic analyze-batch tests/fixtures/semantic/ --swarm --parallel 3"
    Then each file should be processed by different swarm agents
    And all analyses should complete within 30 seconds
    And the swarm should coordinate work distribution efficiently
    And results should be aggregated consistently
    And no agent should exceed 80% CPU utilization

  @semantic-optimization @performance
  Scenario: Semantic query optimization with DAA learning
    Given I have a complex SPARQL query file at "tests/fixtures/semantic/complex-query.sparql"
    And DAA learning is enabled for semantic optimization
    When I run "unjucks semantic query tests/fixtures/semantic/ontology.ttl --query-file tests/fixtures/semantic/complex-query.sparql --optimize --learn"
    Then the query should be automatically optimized
    And execution time should improve over multiple runs
    And the DAA should learn from optimization patterns
    And query performance metrics should be tracked
    And results should maintain semantic correctness

  @semantic-validation @security
  Scenario: RDF validation with security scanning
    Given I have an RDF file with potential security issues at "tests/fixtures/semantic/untrusted.ttl"
    When I run "unjucks semantic validate tests/fixtures/semantic/untrusted.ttl --security-scan --strict"
    Then security vulnerabilities should be detected and reported
    And malicious URIs should be flagged
    And validation should include injection attack detection
    And the command should provide security recommendations
    And exit code should be 1 for security violations

  @semantic-neural @advanced
  Scenario: Neural-enhanced semantic reasoning
    Given I have an ontology with inference rules at "tests/fixtures/semantic/inference-rules.ttl"
    And neural reasoning is enabled
    When I run "unjucks semantic infer tests/fixtures/semantic/inference-rules.ttl --neural-reasoning --confidence-threshold 0.8"
    Then new semantic relationships should be inferred
    And confidence scores should be provided for each inference
    And neural patterns should enhance traditional reasoning
    And inference results should be exportable in multiple formats
    And the reasoning process should be explainable

  @semantic-templates @integration
  Scenario: Semantic template generation with RDF integration
    Given I have an RDF schema at "tests/fixtures/semantic/person-schema.ttl"
    When I run "unjucks semantic generate-template tests/fixtures/semantic/person-schema.ttl --template-type entity --output templates/"
    Then template files should be generated based on RDF schema
    And generated templates should include semantic annotations
    And template variables should map to RDF properties
    And validation rules should be derived from schema constraints
    And the generated templates should be syntactically correct

  @semantic-memory @persistence
  Scenario: Semantic knowledge persistence and retrieval
    Given I have processed several RDF files with semantic analysis
    When I run "unjucks semantic memory store --namespace knowledge-base --ttl 86400"
    And I run "unjucks semantic memory query --pattern 'hasProperty rdfs:label ?label' --limit 10"
    Then semantic knowledge should be persisted in memory
    And queries should return relevant semantic facts
    And knowledge retrieval should be fast (< 100ms)
    And memory usage should be optimized for large knowledge bases
    And cross-session persistence should work correctly

  @semantic-federation @distributed
  Scenario: Federated semantic queries across distributed sources
    Given I have multiple distributed RDF endpoints configured
    And the semantic engine supports federation
    When I run "unjucks semantic federate-query --endpoints 'http://endpoint1,http://endpoint2' --query 'SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' --timeout 30"
    Then the query should be distributed across all endpoints
    And results should be merged consistently
    And endpoint failures should be handled gracefully
    And query performance should be optimized
    And federation metadata should be tracked

  @semantic-real-time @streaming
  Scenario: Real-time semantic processing with streaming updates
    Given I have a streaming RDF data source
    And real-time semantic processing is enabled
    When I run "unjucks semantic stream --source ws://data-stream --window-size 1000 --update-frequency 5s"
    Then streaming RDF data should be processed in real-time
    And semantic insights should be updated continuously
    And processing latency should be under 100ms
    And memory usage should remain stable over time
    And streaming state should be recoverable after interruption

  @semantic-integration @workflow
  Scenario: Semantic analysis integrated with workflow automation
    Given I have a workflow definition with semantic processing steps
    When I run "unjucks workflow execute tests/fixtures/workflows/semantic-pipeline.yaml --semantic-engine neural"
    Then semantic analysis should integrate seamlessly with workflow
    And semantic results should flow between workflow steps
    And error handling should propagate semantic validation failures
    And workflow performance should meet SLA requirements
    And semantic context should be maintained across steps

  @semantic-export @interoperability
  Scenario: Multi-format semantic export with validation
    Given I have processed semantic data in multiple formats
    When I run "unjucks semantic export --formats 'ttl,json-ld,rdf-xml,n3' --validate --output exports/"
    Then semantic data should be exported in all requested formats
    And each export format should be syntactically valid
    And semantic equivalence should be maintained across formats
    And export performance should be optimized
    And format-specific optimizations should be applied
