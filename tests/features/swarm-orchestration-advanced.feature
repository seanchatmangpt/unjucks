    Given I want to create an advanced swarm with neural capabilities
    When I run "unjucks swarm init --topology mesh --agents 8 --neural --architecture transformer --daa --cognitive adaptive"
    Then the swarm should be initialized successfully
    And neural training should be activated for coordination patterns
    And 8 DAA agents should be spawned with adaptive cognitive patterns
    And each agent should have individual neural networks
    And swarm memory should be initialized with cross-session persistence
