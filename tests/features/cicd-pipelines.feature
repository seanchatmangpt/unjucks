    When I generate monitored pipelines
    Then deployment health checks should be configured
    And performance monitoring should be set up
    And alert notifications should be implemented
    And metrics collection should be included

  Scenario: Inject pipeline stages into existing workflows
    Given I have existing CI/CD workflows
    And I have additional pipeline stage templates
    When I inject new pipeline stages
    Then new stages should be integrated into existing workflows
    And stage dependencies should be maintained
    And existing pipeline logic should remain functional
    And workflow execution order should be preserved
