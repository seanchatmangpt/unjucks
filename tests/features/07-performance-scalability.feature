Feature: Performance and Scalability
  As a developer working on large-scale projects

    Given I have unjucks configured for high-performance operations
    And the MCP server is optimized for concurrent requests
    And performance monitoring is enabled

  Scenario: Generating thousands of components in batch
    Given I need to create 10,000 similar components
    When I run "unjucks batch-generate component --count=10000 --pattern=Item_{index} --parallel=true"
    Then all 10,000 components should be generated within reasonable time
    And memory usage should remain stable throughout the process
    And CPU utilization should scale efficiently with available cores
    And progress should be reported in real-time
    And the operation should be interruptible and resumable

  Scenario: Handling very large template files

    Then template changes should be detected immediately
    And only affected files should be regenerated
    And Incremental compilation should be used
    And Hot reloading should work seamlessly
    And System resources should be managed efficiently

    And memory usage should scale linearly with load
    And Connection pooling should be optimized
    And Error rates should remain below acceptable thresholds
    And Resource cleanup should prevent memory leaks

  Scenario: Optimizing semantic RDF processing at scale
    Given I have RDF datasets with millions of triples
    When I run "unjucks generate semantic-app knowledge-graph --triples=5000000"
    Then RDF processing should use streaming parsers
    And Memory usage should be bounded regardless of dataset size
    And SPARQL queries should be optimized for large datasets
    And Indexing should be used to accelerate common operations
    And Progress indicators should show processing status

  Scenario: Handling distributed swarm coordination overhead
    Given I have 50+ AI agents coordinating on complex tasks
    When I run "unjucks swarm large-task --agents=50 --coordination=high-frequency"

    And Resource allocation should be dynamically optimized
    And System stability should be maintained under high coordination load

  Scenario: Optimizing template variable substitution performance
    Given templates with thousands of variable substitutions

    And Memory allocation should be minimized during substitution
    And Performance should scale linearly with variable count
    And Complex expressions should be pre-compiled where possible

  Scenario: Scaling file system operations

  Scenario: Managing memory usage with complex object graphs
    Given templates that create complex interconnected object structures

    And Retry logic should be implemented with exponential backoff
    And Network timeouts should be handled gracefully

  Scenario: Scaling real-time collaboration features
    Given 1000+ developers collaborating on template development
    When they use "unjucks collaborate --real-time=true --users=1000"

    And Conflict resolution should be automatic and efficient
    And Version control integration should scale with user count
    And Operational transformation should handle concurrent edits
    And System should remain responsive under high collaboration load

  Scenario: Performance testing with realistic workloads
