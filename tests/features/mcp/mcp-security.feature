Feature: MCP Security Validation
  As a security-conscious developer
  I want to ensure MCP tools are secure
  So that AI assistants cannot compromise the system

  Background:
    Given I have a clean test environment
    And the MCP server is running
    And I have test templates available

  Scenario: Path Traversal Attack Prevention
    When I call "unjucks_generate" with destination="../../../etc/passwd"
    Then the request should be rejected
    And an appropriate security error should be returned
    And no files should be created outside the project
    And the error should be logged securely

  Scenario: Command Injection Prevention  
    When I call "unjucks_generate" with componentName="; rm -rf /"
    Then the variable should be safely sanitized
    And no system commands should be executed
    And the template should render with escaped content
    And the operation should complete safely

  Scenario: File System Boundary Enforcement
    When I call "unjucks_inject" targeting "/etc/hosts"
    Then the operation should be blocked
    And a security error should be returned
    And system files should remain untouched
    And the attempt should be logged

  Scenario: Input Validation Against XSS
    When I call "unjucks_help" with generator="<script>alert('xss')</script>"
    Then the input should be sanitized
    And no script execution should occur
    And the response should be safe
    And the error should be handled gracefully

  Scenario: Resource Exhaustion Protection
    When I call "unjucks_generate" with extremely large variables
    Then the request should be rate-limited
    And memory usage should be controlled
    And the operation should timeout appropriately
    And system resources should be protected

  Scenario: Concurrent Request Limits
    When I make 100 simultaneous MCP requests
    Then requests should be throttled appropriately
    And server should remain responsive
    And no denial of service should occur
    And error responses should be proper
