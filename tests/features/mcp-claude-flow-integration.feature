Feature: MCP-Claude Flow Integration for Fortune 5 Enterprise Scenarios
  As a Fortune 5 enterprise development team
  I want to orchestrate complex code generation workflows through MCP-Claude Flow integration
  So that I can deliver consistent, compliant, and scalable solutions across all business units

  Background:
    Given I have a clean test environment with MCP server running
    And I have the Claude Flow MCP tools available
    And I have built the Unjucks CLI with MCP integration
    And I have initialized the swarm topology for enterprise workflows

  @fortune5 @api-standardization @critical
  Scenario: API Standardization Across 100+ Microservices
    Given I have enterprise API standardization templates
    And I have microservice metadata in Turtle/RDF format
    And I need to generate 5 different microservice APIs
    When I orchestrate parallel API generation using Claude Flow swarm
    Then all microservice APIs should follow consistent patterns
    And OpenAPI documentation should be automatically generated
    And security middleware should be consistently integrated
    And API endpoints should have uniform error handling
    And the generation should complete in under 30 seconds for all services

  @fortune5 @compliance-scaffolding @critical  
  Scenario: Compliance-Ready Service Scaffolding Generation
    Given I have compliance templates for SOX/GDPR/HIPAA requirements
    And I have regulatory metadata in RDF format
    And I need to scaffold 3 services with different compliance levels
    When I orchestrate compliance scaffolding using swarm coordination
    Then each service should include required compliance configurations
    And audit logging should be automatically configured
    And security headers and encryption should match compliance level
    And monitoring and alerting should be compliance-ready
    And all compliance documentation should be auto-generated

  @fortune5 @database-migrations @critical
  Scenario: Automated Database Migration Script Generation  
    Given I have database schema templates with dependency tracking
    And I have schema evolution metadata in Turtle format
    And I need to generate migrations for 4 interconnected databases
    When I orchestrate database migration generation with dependency resolution
    Then migration scripts should be generated in correct dependency order
    And rollback procedures should be included for every migration
    And cross-database consistency checks should be implemented
    And migration validation tests should be auto-generated
    And the entire migration workflow should be atomic

  @fortune5 @cicd-standardization @critical
  Scenario: Standardized CI/CD Pipeline Generation for Multi-Stack
    Given I have CI/CD pipeline templates for different tech stacks
    And I have deployment policies in RDF format
    And I need to generate pipelines for 6 different application types
    When I orchestrate CI/CD pipeline generation using swarm intelligence
    Then all pipelines should enforce consistent security scanning
    And testing requirements should match application criticality levels
    And deployment strategies should adapt to target environments
    And multi-cloud deployment configurations should be generated
    And pipeline governance should be automatically enforced

  @fortune5 @documentation-generation @critical
  Scenario: Enterprise Documentation Generation from Code Annotations
    Given I have documentation templates for API and compliance docs
    And I have semantic metadata extracted from codebases
    And I need to generate documentation for 8 different service APIs
    When I orchestrate documentation generation using parallel agents
    Then API documentation should reflect actual implementation
    And compliance documentation should be automatically generated
    And documentation should stay synchronized with code changes
    And multi-format outputs should be generated (MD, HTML, PDF)
    And documentation should include interactive API explorers

  @swarm-coordination @real-integration
  Scenario: Real-Time Swarm Coordination During Generation
    Given I have multiple complex generation tasks queued
    And I have Claude Flow swarm initialized with mesh topology
    And I have memory sharing enabled between agents
    When I execute concurrent generation across all Fortune 5 scenarios
    Then agents should coordinate through shared memory
    And work should be distributed efficiently across available agents
    And failed tasks should be automatically reassigned
    And progress should be tracked in real-time
    And final results should be consolidated correctly

  @memory-persistence @agent-coordination  
  Scenario: Cross-Session Memory and Agent State Persistence
    Given I have long-running generation workflows
    And I have Claude Flow memory persistence enabled
    And I need to maintain state across multiple CLI invocations
    When I start a complex generation workflow and interrupt it
    Then the workflow state should be persisted to memory
    And agents should be able to resume from the last checkpoint
    And intermediate results should be preserved
    And the workflow should complete successfully after resumption
    And all generated artifacts should maintain consistency

  @error-handling @fault-tolerance
  Scenario: Error Handling and Recovery in Swarm Operations
    Given I have generation tasks that may fail intermittently
    And I have fault-tolerant swarm configuration
    And I have error recovery policies defined
    When I execute generation with simulated network/disk failures
    Then failed operations should be automatically retried
    And partial results should not corrupt the final output
    And error details should be logged with full context
    And the swarm should continue operating with reduced capacity
    And recovery should be automatic without user intervention

  @performance @benchmarking
  Scenario: Performance Benchmarking of MCP-Claude Flow Integration  
    Given I have performance benchmarking enabled
    And I have baseline metrics for standalone generation
    And I need to generate large-scale enterprise templates
    When I execute the same workload with and without swarm coordination
    Then swarm coordination should provide measurable performance benefits
    And parallel execution should show linear scalability up to 8 agents
    And memory usage should remain stable under load
    And throughput should exceed 100 files per minute
    And error rates should remain below 0.1%

  @real-file-operations @no-mocks
  Scenario: Comprehensive File System Integration Testing
    Given I have complex file structures to generate
    And I need to test all injection modes (inject, append, prepend, lineAt)
    And I have concurrent file operations across multiple agents
    When I execute file generation with race condition potential
    Then all file operations should be atomic and consistent
    And idempotent operations should not create duplicates
    And file permissions should be correctly set
    And concurrent writes should not corrupt file contents
    And the file system should be in a consistent state after all operations

  @mcp-protocol @integration-validation
  Scenario: MCP Protocol Compliance and Tool Integration
    Given I have MCP tools properly configured
    And I have Claude Flow MCP server running
    And I need to validate all MCP tool interactions
    When I execute workflows using various MCP tools
    Then all MCP requests should follow proper JSON-RPC protocol
    And tool responses should be properly handled
    And error conditions should be gracefully managed
    And MCP server should remain stable under load
    And tool integration should provide value over direct CLI usage
