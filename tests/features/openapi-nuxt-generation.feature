Feature: OpenAPI to Nuxt Generation with MCP-Claude Flow Integration
  As a Nuxt developer working with AI APIs
  I want to generate complete Nuxt applications from OpenAPI specifications
  So that I can rapidly scaffold type-safe, production-ready applications with streaming support

  Background:
    Given I have a clean test environment with MCP server running
    And I have the Claude Flow MCP tools available
    And I have built the Unjucks CLI with MCP integration
    And I have initialized the swarm topology for OpenAPI workflows

  Scenario: Parse and validate OpenAPI specification
    Given I have the Ollama AI Provider v2 OpenAPI specification
    When I parse the OpenAPI specification with validation
    Then the parsing should succeed without errors
    And I should extract all API operations and schemas
    And I should identify authentication requirements
    And I should detect streaming endpoints
    And I should get structured data for template generation

  Scenario: Generate Nuxt composables from OpenAPI operations
    Given I have a validated OpenAPI specification
    And I have Nuxt OpenAPI templates for composables
    When I orchestrate parallel composable generation using Claude Flow swarm
    Then I should get type-safe composables for each API operation
    And composables should include proper error handling
    And composables should support streaming responses where applicable
    And composables should include authentication headers
    And all generated composables should follow Nuxt 3 patterns

  Scenario: Generate server API routes from OpenAPI paths
    Given I have OpenAPI specification with defined paths
    And I have Nuxt server API route templates
    When I generate server-side API routes with swarm coordination
    Then I should get server routes for each OpenAPI path
    And routes should include input validation middleware
    And routes should proxy to external API with proper error handling
    And routes should handle streaming responses correctly
    And routes should include rate limiting and caching

  Scenario: Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI schemas
    Given I have OpenAPI specification with component schemas
    And I have TypeScript type generation templates
    When I orchestrate type generation using specialized agents
    Then I should get complete TypeScript interfaces for all schemas
    And types should include proper JSDoc documentation
    And types should handle optional and required fields correctly
    And types should support nested object structures
    And types should include validation schemas

  Scenario: Generate authentication middleware
    Given I have OpenAPI specification with security schemes
    And I have authentication middleware templates
    When I generate authentication infrastructure
    Then I should get middleware for each security scheme
    And middleware should support API key authentication
    And middleware should support Bearer token authentication
    And middleware should include token validation
    And middleware should handle authentication errors gracefully

  Scenario: Generate complete Nuxt application structure
    Given I have processed OpenAPI specification
    And I have complete Nuxt application templates
    When I orchestrate full application scaffolding using swarm
    Then I should get a complete Nuxt 3 project structure
    And I should get proper Nuxt configuration files
    And I should get plugin registrations for authentication
    And I should get example pages demonstrating API usage
    And I should get comprehensive documentation

  Scenario: Handle streaming responses for AI endpoints
    Given I have OpenAPI specification with streaming endpoints
    And I have streaming response templates
    When I generate streaming-capable components
    Then I should get composables that handle Server-Sent Events
    And I should get components that display streaming responses
    And I should get proper error handling for stream interruptions
    And I should get cancel/abort functionality for streams

  Scenario: Swarm coordination for parallel generation
    Given I have initialized the Claude Flow swarm
    And I have multiple generation tasks identified
    When I orchestrate parallel generation across swarm agents
    Then each agent should handle specific generation responsibilities
    And agents should share OpenAPI parsed data through memory
    And agents should coordinate file generation without conflicts
    And agents should validate each other's generated output
    And the swarm should complete all tasks within performance limits

  Scenario: Error handling and rollback mechanisms
    Given I have initiated OpenAPI generation process
    When an error occurs during generation
    Then the system should detect the failure immediately
    And the system should rollback any partially generated files
    And the system should provide clear error messages
    And the system should preserve any valid generated artifacts
    And the system should suggest corrective actions

  Scenario: Performance benchmarking for large OpenAPI specs
    Given I have a large OpenAPI specification with 50+ operations
    And I have performance monitoring enabled
    When I generate the complete Nuxt application
    Then the generation should complete within reasonable time limits
    And memory usage should remain within acceptable bounds
    And the swarm should scale appropriately for the workload
    And performance metrics should be recorded for analysis

  Scenario: Validation of generated Nuxt application
    Given I have generated a complete Nuxt application from OpenAPI
    When I validate the generated application structure
    Then all TypeScript types should compile without errors
    And all composables should pass type checking
    And all server routes should have proper middleware chains
    And the Nuxt application should build successfully
    And all generated tests should pass
    And the application should start without runtime errors

  Scenario: Integration testing with real API calls
    Given I have generated Nuxt application with API integration
    And I have access to a running Ollama API instance
    When I test the generated API integration
    Then the composables should make successful API calls
    And authentication should work correctly
    And streaming responses should be handled properly
    And error scenarios should be handled gracefully
    And the application should remain responsive during API calls

  Scenario: Documentation generation from OpenAPI
    Given I have OpenAPI specification with comprehensive documentation
    And I have documentation generation templates
    When I generate application documentation
    Then I should get comprehensive API usage documentation
    And I should get component usage examples
    And I should get authentication setup instructions
    And I should get troubleshooting guides
    And documentation should be integrated with the Nuxt application

  Scenario: Dry-run mode for OpenAPI generation
    Given I have OpenAPI specification ready for processing
    When I run the generation process in dry-run mode
    Then I should see a preview of all files to be generated
    And I should see the complete directory structure
    And I should see variable substitutions and transformations
    And no actual files should be created
    And I should get estimates of generation time and complexity
