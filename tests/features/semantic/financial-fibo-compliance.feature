Feature: Financial FIBO Compliance with Basel III and SOX
  As a financial services developer
  I want to process financial instrument data using FIBO ontologies
  So that I can ensure regulatory compliance with Basel III and SOX

  Background:
    Given I have FIBO (Financial Industry Business Ontology) loaded
    And Basel III regulatory rules are configured
    And SOX compliance validation is enabled
    And real financial instrument data is available

  Scenario: Process Derivatives Portfolio with FIBO Classification
    Given I have a derivatives portfolio with 500 instruments
    And each instrument has FIBO-compliant metadata
    When I process the portfolio through financial templates
    Then instruments should be properly classified using FIBO types
    And risk calculations should follow Basel III methodologies
    And counterparty exposure should be accurately computed
    And all calculations should be auditable per SOX requirements

  Scenario: Generate Regulatory Capital Reports
    Given I have bank portfolio data with various asset classes
    And FIBO risk ontologies are loaded
    When I generate Basel III capital adequacy reports
    Then risk-weighted assets should be calculated correctly
    And capital ratios should meet regulatory minimums
    And leverage ratios should be computed per Basel III rules
    And reports should be generated in XBRL format

  Scenario: Trade Settlement Risk Analysis
    Given I have trade settlement data with counterparty information
    And FIBO party and agreement ontologies are loaded
    When I analyze settlement risk exposure
    Then counterparty credit ratings should be properly weighted
    And settlement timeframes should affect risk calculations
    And netting agreements should be factored into exposure
    And concentration risk should be identified and reported

  Scenario: SOX Financial Controls Validation
    Given I have financial transaction data processed through templates
    And SOX control requirements are defined in RDF
    When I validate control compliance
    Then all material transactions should have proper authorization trails
    And segregation of duties should be verified
    And financial data integrity should be mathematically validated
    And control deficiencies should be automatically flagged

  Scenario: Cross-Jurisdiction Regulatory Mapping
    Given I have financial instruments traded in multiple jurisdictions
    And regulatory ontologies for US, EU, and Asia-Pacific are loaded
    When I map instruments to applicable regulations
    Then jurisdiction-specific rules should be correctly applied
    And regulatory conflicts should be identified
    And compliance status should be reported per jurisdiction
    And consolidation should follow IFRS/GAAP standards

  Scenario: High-Frequency Trading Compliance Monitoring
    Given I have millisecond-level trading data streams
    And algorithmic trading rules are encoded in RDF
    When I monitor trading activity in real-time
    Then market manipulation patterns should be detected
    And position limits should be enforced automatically
    And best execution requirements should be validated
    And suspicious activity should trigger immediate alerts
