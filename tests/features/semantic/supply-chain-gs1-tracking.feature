Feature: Supply Chain GS1 Tracking with Anti-Counterfeiting
  As a supply chain manager
  I want to track products using GS1 standards and semantic templates
  So that I can prevent counterfeiting and ensure product authenticity

  Background:
    Given I have GS1 product catalog data loaded
    And EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is configured
    And blockchain-based provenance tracking is enabled
    And anti-counterfeiting validation rules are active

  Scenario: Track Product Journey from Manufacture to Retail
    Given I have a batch of pharmaceutical products with GS1 GTINs
    And each product has EPCIS events for manufacturing, shipping, and receiving
    When I trace the complete product journey
    Then all supply chain events should be chronologically ordered
    And custody transfers should be cryptographically verified
    And any gaps in the chain of custody should be flagged
    And product authenticity should be validated at each step

  Scenario: Detect Counterfeit Products in Supply Chain
    Given I have product authentication data from multiple sources
    And known counterfeit product signatures are in the system
    When I analyze incoming product batches
    Then suspicious patterns should be automatically detected
    And counterfeit probability scores should be calculated
    And supply chain anomalies should trigger immediate alerts
    And legitimate products should be clearly differentiated

  Scenario: Generate Product Recall Notifications
    Given I have identified a contaminated product batch
    And the batch has been distributed across multiple retailers
    When I initiate a product recall process
    Then all affected products should be identified by GTIN
    And downstream distribution channels should be mapped
    And recall notifications should be sent to all stakeholders
    And recall effectiveness should be tracked and reported

  Scenario: Cross-Border Trade Documentation
    Given I have products crossing international borders
    And each jurisdiction has specific documentation requirements
    When I generate trade compliance documentation
    Then customs declarations should include accurate GS1 data
    And product classifications should match HS codes
    And certificates of origin should be automatically generated
    And regulatory compliance should be verified per destination

  Scenario: Sustainability and ESG Reporting
    Given I have supply chain data with environmental impact metrics
    And ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria are defined
    When I generate sustainability reports
    Then carbon footprint should be calculated per product
    And ethical sourcing should be verified through provenance
    And social impact metrics should be aggregated
    And ESG compliance scores should be computed automatically

  Scenario: Large-Scale Product Catalog Processing
    Given I have a product catalog with 1 million+ SKUs
    And each product has complex attribute relationships
    When I process the entire catalog for semantic enrichment
    Then processing should complete within 5 minutes
    And all GS1 standards should be maintained
    And product relationships should be preserved
    And search and discovery performance should remain optimal
