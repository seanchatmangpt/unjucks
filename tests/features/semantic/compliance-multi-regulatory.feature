Feature: Multi-Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, PCI-DSS, Cross-Jurisdiction)
  As a compliance officer
  I want to process data across multiple regulatory frameworks
  So that I can ensure simultaneous compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other regulations

  Background:
    Given I have multi-jurisdictional regulatory ontologies loaded
    And GDPR privacy rules are configured in RDF
    And PCI-DSS security requirements are encoded
    And cross-border data transfer rules are active

  Scenario: Process Personal Data with GDPR Compliance
    Given I have personal data from EU citizens
    And the data includes PII, behavioral data, and preferences
    When I process the data through privacy-aware templates
    Then consent status should be validated for each data element
    And data minimization principles should be automatically applied
    And retention periods should be enforced per data category
    And anonymization should be applied where legally required

  Scenario: Handle Payment Card Data per PCI-DSS
    Given I have payment transaction data with card details
    And PCI-DSS Level 1 requirements are configured
    When I process payment data through secure templates
    Then cardholder data should be properly tokenized
    And encryption should meet PCI-DSS standards
    And access controls should be verified and logged
    And sensitive authentication data should never be stored

  Scenario: Cross-Border Data Transfer Validation
    Given I have data subjects from multiple jurisdictions
    And each jurisdiction has specific data protection laws
    When I validate cross-border data transfers
    Then adequacy decisions should be automatically checked
    And appropriate safeguards should be verified (SCCs, BCRs)
    And data localization requirements should be enforced
    And transfer logs should be maintained for audit purposes

  Scenario: Data Subject Rights Fulfillment
    Given I receive data subject rights requests (access, rectification, erasure)
    And personal data is distributed across multiple systems
    When I process the rights request
    Then all personal data should be discovered and mapped
    And data portability should be provided in structured format
    And erasure should be completed within legal timeframes
    And third-party processors should be notified of changes

  Scenario: Breach Notification and Impact Assessment
    Given a data breach has been detected in the system
    And the breach affects personal data and payment cards
    When I assess the breach impact
    Then GDPR breach notification timeline should be calculated
    And PCI-DSS incident response procedures should be triggered
    And risk levels should be assessed per regulatory framework
    And notification templates should be generated automatically

  Scenario: Regulatory Conflict Resolution
    Given I have data processing requirements that conflict across regulations
    And multiple regulatory frameworks apply simultaneously
    When I analyze compliance requirements
    Then conflicts should be identified and flagged
    And the most restrictive requirements should be recommended
    And compliance gaps should be documented with remediation steps
    And legal review requirements should be automatically triggered
