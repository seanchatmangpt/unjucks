Feature: Semantic MCP Integration with N3/TTL Reasoning
  As a developer using semantic knowledge graphs
  I want to integrate N3 reasoning with MCP tools
  So that I can process enterprise ontologies and apply semantic reasoning

  Background:
    Given the semantic MCP integration is initialized
    And N3.js reasoning engine is available
    And TTL schema processing is enabled

  Scenario: Validate Enterprise Ontology with N3 Reasoning Rules
    Given I have an enterprise ontology file "enterprise-schema.ttl"
    And I have N3 reasoning rules "compliance-rules.n3"
    When I invoke the semantic validation MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_semantic_validate |
      | schema_file | tests/fixtures/turtle/enterprise-schema.ttl |
      | rules_file | tests/fixtures/turtle/compliance-rules.n3 |
      | validation_level | strict |
    Then the validation should succeed
    And the result should contain semantic violations if any
    And the reasoning engine should apply all compliance rules
    And the output should include "validation_passed: true"

  Scenario: Apply N3 Reasoning Rules to Generate Template Variables
    Given I have a knowledge base "api-governance.ttl"
    And I have inference rules "governance-rules.n3"
    When I invoke the reasoning MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_reasoning_apply |
      | knowledge_base | tests/fixtures/turtle/api-governance.ttl |
      | rules | tests/fixtures/turtle/governance-rules.n3 |
      | output_format | template_variables |
    Then the reasoning should complete successfully
    And the result should contain inferred template variables
    And the variables should include governance policies
    And the output should be compatible with Nunjucks templates

  Scenario: Query Knowledge Graph with SPARQL-like Syntax
    Given I have a populated knowledge graph "fortune5-compliance.ttl"
    When I invoke the knowledge query MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_knowledge_query |
      | graph_file | tests/fixtures/turtle/fortune5-compliance.ttl |
      | query | SELECT ?api ?policy WHERE { ?api compliance:hasPolicy ?policy } |
      | limit | 100 |
    Then the query should execute successfully
    And the result should contain API compliance mappings
    And the results should be structured as template variables
    And each result should have "api" and "policy" properties

  Scenario: Enforce Semantic Compliance Policies in Templates
    Given I have compliance ontology "sox-compliance.ttl"
    And I have a template that generates financial APIs
    When I invoke the compliance check MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_compliance_check |
      | ontology | tests/fixtures/turtle/sox-compliance.ttl |
      | template_dir | tests/fixtures/templates/financial-api |
      | policy_level | sox |
    Then the compliance check should complete
    And violations should be reported if any
    And recommendations should be provided for non-compliant templates
    And the output should include remediation steps

  Scenario: Real-time Semantic Reasoning During Template Generation
    Given I have a semantic template with RDF frontmatter
    And the template references enterprise vocabularies
    When I generate code using semantic MCP integration
      | generator | api-service |
      | template | semantic-rest-api |
      | semantic_reasoning | enabled |
      | ontology | tests/fixtures/turtle/api-ontology.ttl |
    Then semantic reasoning should be applied during generation
    And the generated code should conform to semantic constraints
    And compliance annotations should be embedded in output
    And the generation metadata should include reasoning results

  Scenario: Validate TTL Schema Evolution and Compatibility
    Given I have a base schema "schema-v1.ttl"
    And I have an evolved schema "schema-v2.ttl"
    When I invoke the schema evolution MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_schema_evolution |
      | base_schema | tests/fixtures/turtle/schema-v1.ttl |
      | evolved_schema | tests/fixtures/turtle/schema-v2.ttl |
      | compatibility_level | backward |
    Then the evolution analysis should complete
    And breaking changes should be identified
    And migration recommendations should be provided
    And compatibility issues should be flagged

  Scenario: Process Large Enterprise Knowledge Graphs
    Given I have a large enterprise knowledge graph "enterprise-kb.ttl"
    And the graph contains 10000+ triples
    When I invoke the large graph processing MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_knowledge_process |
      | graph_file | tests/fixtures/turtle/enterprise-kb.ttl |
      | processing_mode | streaming |
      | memory_limit | 512MB |
    Then processing should complete within acceptable time limits
    And memory usage should remain under the limit
    And progress should be reported during processing
    And the result should maintain data integrity

  Scenario: Generate Enterprise API Documentation from Semantic Models
    Given I have an API semantic model "api-model.ttl"
    And the model includes OpenAPI annotations
    When I invoke the semantic documentation MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_semantic_docs |
      | model_file | tests/fixtures/turtle/api-model.ttl |
      | output_format | openapi |
      | include_reasoning | true |
    Then OpenAPI documentation should be generated
    And the documentation should include semantic annotations
    And compliance requirements should be documented
    And the output should be valid OpenAPI 3.0

  Scenario: Cross-validate Multiple Ontologies for Consistency
    Given I have multiple domain ontologies
      | file | domain |
      | security-ontology.ttl | security |
      | api-ontology.ttl | api |
      | compliance-ontology.ttl | compliance |
    When I invoke the cross-validation MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_ontology_validate |
      | ontologies | tests/fixtures/turtle/security-ontology.ttl,tests/fixtures/turtle/api-ontology.ttl,tests/fixtures/turtle/compliance-ontology.ttl |
      | consistency_check | true |
    Then cross-validation should complete
    And consistency conflicts should be reported
    And alignment recommendations should be provided
    And a unified vocabulary mapping should be generated

  Scenario: Transform Legacy Data Models to Semantic Models
    Given I have a legacy JSON schema "legacy-schema.json"
    And I have mapping rules "json-to-rdf.n3"
    When I invoke the semantic transformation MCP tool
      | tool_name | unjucks_semantic_transform |
      | source_schema | tests/fixtures/schemas/legacy-schema.json |
      | mapping_rules | tests/fixtures/turtle/json-to-rdf.n3 |
      | target_format | turtle |
    Then the transformation should complete successfully
    And the output should be valid Turtle/TTL
    And semantic relationships should be preserved
    And the result should be queryable via SPARQL

  Scenario: Handle Semantic MCP Tool Errors Gracefully
    Given I have an invalid TTL file "invalid.ttl"
    When I invoke any semantic MCP tool with the invalid file
    Then the tool should fail gracefully
    And detailed error messages should be provided
    And suggestions for fixing the TTL should be included
    And the MCP protocol should remain stable

  Scenario: Performance Benchmark for Semantic Reasoning
    Given I have a complex ontology with inference rules
    And the ontology contains 50000+ triples
    When I benchmark the semantic reasoning performance
      | tool_name | unjucks_reasoning_benchmark |
      | ontology | tests/fixtures/turtle/complex-ontology.ttl |
      | rules | tests/fixtures/turtle/complex-rules.n3 |
      | iterations | 100 |
    Then reasoning should complete within performance thresholds
    And memory usage should be tracked and reported
    And performance metrics should be logged
    And bottlenecks should be identified

  Scenario: Semantic Template Variable Validation
    Given I have a template with semantic variable declarations
    And the template uses enterprise vocabularies
    When I validate the semantic template variables
      | tool_name | unjucks_template_semantic_validate |
      | template_dir | tests/fixtures/templates/semantic-api |
      | vocabularies | tests/fixtures/turtle/enterprise-vocabs.ttl |
    Then variable declarations should be validated
    And vocabulary usage should be checked
    And type compatibility should be verified
    And recommendations for improvements should be provided
