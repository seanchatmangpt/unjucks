Feature: MCP Semantic Coordination
  As a Fortune 5 enterprise architect
  I want AI agent swarms that understand semantic web data
  So that I can coordinate intelligent code generation from enterprise ontologies

  Background:
    Given I have a clean MCP coordination environment
    And I have semantic-aware agents available
    And I have enterprise ontology data

  Scenario: Initialize MCP swarm with semantic capabilities
    Given I need to coordinate semantic-aware agents
    When I initialize MCP swarm coordination
    Then the swarm should initialize successfully
    And all agents should have semantic context loaded
    And swarm topology should be optimized for semantic processing

  Scenario: Coordinate multi-agent semantic code generation
    Given I have a complex enterprise domain ontology
    And I have semantic-aware agents coordinated
    When I orchestrate semantic code generation workflow
    Then domain expert agents should extract bounded contexts
    And schema validator agents should ensure consistency
    And code generator agents should create implementations
    And template renderer agents should apply semantic context
    And all agents should coordinate via shared semantic memory

  Scenario: Handle semantic coordination failures gracefully
    Given I have an invalid ontology file
    When I attempt semantic coordination with invalid data
    Then the coordination should fail gracefully
    And agents should report specific failure reasons
    And the system should continue with degraded functionality

  Scenario: Performance optimization for large semantic datasets
    Given I have a large enterprise ontology with 10K+ triples
    When I coordinate semantic processing with performance monitoring
    Then semantic parsing should complete within SLA
    And agent coordination should be optimized
    And memory usage should remain stable
    And total workflow should meet performance targets

  Scenario: Cached semantic coordination for repeat operations
    Given I have previously processed semantic data
    When I repeat the same semantic coordination
    Then cached parsing should be dramatically faster
    And total coordination time should be optimized
