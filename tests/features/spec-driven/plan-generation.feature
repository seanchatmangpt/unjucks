Feature: Plan Generation from Specifications
  As a project manager
  I want to generate development plans from specifications
  So that I can organize work efficiently and track progress

  Background:
    Given I have valid specifications
    And the plan generation system is available

  Scenario: Generating basic development plan
    Given I have a specification for "UserAuthentication"
    When I generate a development plan
    Then the plan should include:
      | phase        | description                  |
      | analysis     | Requirement analysis         |
      | design       | System design                |
      | development  | Implementation               |
      | testing      | Testing and validation       |
      | deployment   | Release preparation          |
    And each phase should have estimated duration
    And dependencies between phases should be identified

  Scenario: Plan generation with custom templates
    Given I have a specification and a custom plan template
    When I generate a plan using template "agile-sprint"
    Then the plan should follow agile methodology
    And it should include sprint planning
    And it should have story points estimation
    And it should define acceptance criteria for each task

  Scenario: Multi-specification plan generation
    Given I have multiple related specifications:
      | name               | priority | complexity |
      | UserAuthentication | high     | medium     |
      | UserProfile        | medium   | low        |
      | UserPreferences    | low      | low        |
    When I generate a comprehensive plan
    Then specifications should be prioritized correctly
    And dependencies should be resolved
    And the plan should optimize for parallel development
    And resource allocation should be considered

  Scenario: Plan customization and refinement
    Given I have a generated development plan
    When I customize the plan by:
      | action          | target      | value    |
      | adjust_duration | development | 2 weeks  |
      | add_milestone   | testing     | QA Gate  |
      | assign_resource | frontend    | 2 devs   |
    Then the plan should be updated accordingly
    And all dependent tasks should be recalculated
    And timeline should be adjusted automatically
    And resource conflicts should be identified

  Scenario: Plan validation and feasibility check
    Given I have a development plan
    When I validate the plan feasibility
    Then it should check resource availability
    And it should validate timeline constraints
    And it should identify potential risks
    And it should suggest optimizations if needed
    And the validation report should be detailed

  Scenario: Iterative plan refinement
    Given I have an initial development plan
    When new requirements are added to specifications
    Then the plan should be automatically updated
    And impact analysis should be performed
    And stakeholders should be notified of changes
    And timeline adjustments should be calculated

  Scenario: Plan export and sharing
    Given I have a finalized development plan
    When I export the plan
    Then I should be able to export to formats:
      | format     | purpose              |
      | Gantt      | Project timeline     |
      | JSON       | System integration   |
      | CSV        | Spreadsheet import   |
      | PDF        | Stakeholder sharing  |
    And exported plans should maintain all details
    And formats should be suitable for their intended use

  Scenario: Plan progress tracking
    Given I have an active development plan
    When I update task progress
    Then the overall plan progress should be recalculated
    And milestone achievements should be tracked
    And delays should be identified automatically
    And stakeholder reports should be generated

  Scenario: Risk-aware plan generation
    Given I have specifications with identified risks
    When I generate a plan with risk mitigation
    Then high-risk tasks should have buffer time
    And risk mitigation strategies should be included
    And contingency plans should be prepared
    And risk monitoring should be built into timeline

  Scenario: Resource-constrained planning
    Given I have limited development resources
    When I generate a plan with resource constraints:
      | resource     | availability |
      | developers   | 3 FTE        |
      | testers      | 1 FTE        |
      | timeline     | 8 weeks      |
    Then the plan should optimize within constraints
    And it should prioritize high-value features
    And it should suggest scope adjustments if needed
    And resource utilization should be maximized
