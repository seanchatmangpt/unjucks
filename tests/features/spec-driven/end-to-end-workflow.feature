Feature: End-to-End Specification-Driven Workflow
  As a product team
  I want to execute complete specification-driven development workflows
  So that I can deliver features efficiently from conception to production

  Background:
    Given I have a complete development environment
    And all specification-driven tools are available
    And I have appropriate permissions and access

  Scenario: Complete feature development lifecycle
    Given I start with a new feature requirement
    When I execute the complete workflow:
      | phase           | duration | deliverables                    |
      | specification   | 2 days   | Validated spec with criteria    |
      | planning        | 1 day    | Development plan with timeline  |
      | task_breakdown  | 1 day    | Actionable tasks with estimates |
      | code_generation | 3 days   | Generated scaffolding and tests |
      | implementation  | 10 days  | Complete feature implementation |
      | testing         | 3 days   | Comprehensive test coverage     |
      | documentation   | 2 days   | User and developer docs         |
      | deployment      | 1 day    | Production-ready release        |
    Then each phase should complete successfully
    And deliverables should meet quality standards
    And the feature should be production-ready
    And all stakeholders should be informed of progress

  Scenario: Rapid prototyping workflow
    Given I need to quickly validate a concept
    When I execute rapid prototyping workflow
    Then I should be able to:
      | action                    | time_limit |
      | Create basic spec         | 30 minutes |
      | Generate MVP code         | 2 hours    |
      | Deploy to staging         | 30 minutes |
      | Gather stakeholder feedback| 1 day     |
      | Iterate based on feedback | 4 hours    |
    And the prototype should demonstrate core functionality
    And feedback should be easily incorporated
    And the prototype should be scalable to full implementation

  Scenario: Multi-team collaboration workflow
    Given I have a feature requiring multiple teams
    When I coordinate across teams:
      | team        | responsibility              | deliverable           |
      | backend     | API and data layer         | REST API service      |
      | frontend    | User interface             | React components      |
      | mobile      | Native app integration     | Mobile screens        |
      | devops      | Infrastructure setup       | Deployment pipeline   |
      | qa          | Testing strategy           | Test automation       |
    Then team coordination should be seamless
    And interfaces between teams should be well-defined
    And integration points should be tested thoroughly
    And delivery should be synchronized across teams

  Scenario: Specification evolution and versioning
    Given I have an active development project
    When requirements change during development
    Then the workflow should handle:
      | change_type        | workflow_adaptation                |
      | scope_addition     | New tasks added to current sprint  |
      | priority_shift     | Task reordering and reassignment   |
      | technical_pivot    | Architecture changes with impact   |
      | timeline_pressure  | Scope reduction with stakeholder   |
    And all changes should be tracked with reasons
    And impact analysis should be automated
    And stakeholders should approve significant changes
    And team should be notified of workflow adjustments

  Scenario: Quality gates integration workflow
    Given I have quality requirements for my project
    When I implement quality gates in the workflow
    Then quality checks should occur at:
      | phase           | quality_gate                    |
      | specification   | Requirements review and approval |
      | code_generation | Generated code meets standards   |
      | implementation  | Code review and testing         |
      | integration     | System integration testing      |
      | deployment      | Security and performance checks |
    And gates should block progression when quality is insufficient
    And feedback should be immediate and actionable
    And quality metrics should be tracked over time

  Scenario: Automated workflow orchestration
    Given I have a complex multi-phase project
    When I enable automated workflow orchestration
    Then the system should:
      | capability              | description                      |
      | trigger_next_phase      | Automatically start next phase  |
      | parallel_execution      | Run independent tasks in parallel|
      | dependency_management   | Enforce task dependencies       |
      | resource_allocation     | Assign work based on capacity   |
      | progress_monitoring     | Track and report progress       |
      | issue_escalation        | Alert when problems occur       |
    And human oversight should be maintained
    And manual intervention should be possible
    And audit trails should be comprehensive

  Scenario: Compliance and governance workflow
    Given I have regulatory compliance requirements
    When I execute compliance-aware workflow
    Then compliance should be ensured through:
      | compliance_area    | enforcement_method              |
      | data_privacy       | GDPR compliance checks          |
      | security           | Security scanning and approval  |
      | accessibility      | WCAG compliance validation      |
      | audit_trails       | Complete change documentation   |
      | approval_process   | Stakeholder sign-off tracking   |
    And compliance artifacts should be automatically generated
    And audit reports should be available on demand
    And non-compliance should trigger immediate alerts

  Scenario: Performance monitoring throughout workflow
    Given I want to optimize my development process
    When I track performance metrics throughout workflow
    Then I should monitor:
      | metric_category    | specific_metrics                |
      | velocity           | Story points per sprint         |
      | quality            | Defect density, test coverage   |
      | efficiency         | Cycle time, lead time           |
      | predictability     | Estimation accuracy             |
      | satisfaction       | Team and stakeholder happiness  |
    And metrics should be visualized in dashboards
    And trends should be analyzed for improvement opportunities
    And benchmarks should be established and maintained

  Scenario: Rollback and recovery workflow
    Given something goes wrong during development
    When I need to rollback or recover
    Then the system should support:
      | recovery_type      | recovery_method                 |
      | specification      | Revert to previous spec version |
      | code_generation    | Regenerate from last good state |
      | deployment         | Automated rollback to previous  |
      | data_migration     | Database rollback procedures    |
    And recovery should be fast and reliable
    And data loss should be prevented
    And recovery procedures should be tested regularly
    And team should be trained on recovery processes

  Scenario: Continuous improvement workflow
    Given I complete development cycles
    When I analyze workflow effectiveness
    Then improvement should be driven by:
      | improvement_source | action_taken                    |
      | retrospective      | Process adjustments             |
      | metrics_analysis   | Bottleneck identification       |
      | team_feedback      | Tool and process enhancements   |
      | industry_trends    | Adoption of best practices      |
    And improvements should be measured and validated
    And successful changes should be standardized
    And the workflow should evolve continuously
    And knowledge should be shared across teams

  Scenario: Integration with external systems
    Given I need to integrate with external systems
    When I execute workflow with external dependencies
    Then integration should be managed through:
      | integration_type   | management_approach             |
      | version_control    | Git workflow with external repos|
      | ci_cd_pipeline     | Jenkins/GitHub Actions integration|
      | project_tracking   | JIRA/Azure DevOps synchronization|
      | communication      | Slack/Teams notifications       |
      | monitoring         | Application performance monitoring|
    And external system changes should not break workflow
    And Integration points should be monitored continuously
    And Fallback procedures should be in place for outages
