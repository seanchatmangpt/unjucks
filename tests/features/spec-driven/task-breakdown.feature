Feature: Task Breakdown from Specifications
  As a development team lead
  I want to break down specifications into actionable tasks
  So that developers can work efficiently with clear objectives

  Background:
    Given I have validated specifications
    And the task breakdown system is initialized

  Scenario: Basic task breakdown
    Given I have a specification "UserAuthentication"
    When I break down the specification into tasks
    Then tasks should be generated for:
      | category      | task_type           | estimated_hours |
      | backend       | API endpoint        | 8               |
      | backend       | Database schema     | 4               |
      | frontend      | Login form          | 6               |
      | frontend      | State management    | 4               |
      | testing       | Unit tests          | 8               |
      | testing       | Integration tests   | 6               |
    And each task should have clear acceptance criteria
    And tasks should be appropriately sized (2-16 hours)

  Scenario: Task dependency resolution
    Given I have broken down a specification into tasks
    When I analyze task dependencies
    Then dependencies should be identified:
      | task                | depends_on          |
      | Login form          | API endpoint        |
      | Integration tests   | Login form          |
      | State management    | API endpoint        |
    And dependency cycles should be detected and prevented
    And execution order should be optimized
    And parallel execution opportunities should be identified

  Scenario: Task estimation and sizing
    Given I have a list of generated tasks
    When I apply estimation techniques
    Then tasks should be estimated using:
      | technique       | purpose                    |
      | story_points    | Relative complexity        |
      | time_hours      | Actual development time    |
      | confidence      | Estimation reliability     |
    And oversized tasks should be automatically split
    And estimation accuracy should be tracked over time
    And historical data should inform future estimates

  Scenario: Task categorization and labeling
    Given I have broken down multiple specifications
    When I categorize and label tasks
    Then tasks should be organized by:
      | dimension   | categories                          |
      | skill       | frontend, backend, devops, testing  |
      | complexity  | simple, medium, complex             |
      | priority    | critical, high, medium, low         |
      | type        | feature, bug, refactor, docs        |
    And filtering should be possible by any dimension
    And team members should be able to find suitable tasks

  Scenario: Hierarchical task structure
    Given I have complex specifications
    When I create hierarchical task breakdown
    Then tasks should be organized in levels:
      | level    | example                           |
      | epic     | User Management System            |
      | feature  | User Authentication               |
      | story    | User can log in with email        |
      | task     | Create login API endpoint         |
      | subtask  | Validate email format             |
    And each level should roll up to parent estimates
    And progress tracking should work at all levels
    And reporting should support different granularities

  Scenario: Task assignment and allocation
    Given I have a breakdown of tasks
    When I assign tasks to team members
    Then assignments should consider:
      | factor           | description                     |
      | skill_match      | Developer expertise alignment   |
      | workload         | Current capacity                |
      | preferences      | Individual development interests |
      | dependencies     | Task interdependencies          |
    And workload should be balanced across team
    And skill development opportunities should be identified
    And assignments should be optimized for team velocity

  Scenario: Dynamic task refinement
    Given I have initial task breakdown
    When new information becomes available
    Then tasks should be refined by:
      | action        | trigger                    |
      | splitting     | Task proving too large     |
      | merging       | Related small tasks        |
      | reprioritizing | Changing business needs   |
      | re-estimating | Better understanding       |
    And all changes should be tracked with reasons
    And team should be notified of significant changes
    And impact on timeline should be calculated

  Scenario: Task template application
    Given I have specifications of similar types
    When I apply task breakdown templates
    Then common patterns should be reused:
      | template_type    | typical_tasks                      |
      | crud_api        | Create, Read, Update, Delete ops   |
      | ui_component    | Design, Implement, Test, Document  |
      | data_migration  | Plan, Script, Test, Execute        |
    And templates should be customizable
    And new templates should be learned from patterns
    And template effectiveness should be measured

  Scenario: Cross-team coordination tasks
    Given I have specifications requiring multiple teams
    When I generate coordination tasks
    Then coordination tasks should include:
      | task_type        | description                    |
      | interface_design | API contract definition        |
      | integration_test | Cross-system validation        |
      | deployment_sync  | Coordinated release planning   |
      | documentation    | Shared knowledge artifacts     |
    And ownership should be clearly defined
    And communication checkpoints should be scheduled
    And integration risks should be mitigated

  Scenario: Task progress and completion tracking
    Given I have active development tasks
    When I track task progress
    Then progress should be measured by:
      | metric          | purpose                        |
      | completion_%    | Work done vs remaining         |
      | velocity        | Tasks completed per timeframe  |
      | cycle_time      | Task start to completion       |
      | blocked_time    | Time spent waiting             |
    And bottlenecks should be automatically identified
    And predictive completion dates should be calculated
    And team performance trends should be tracked

  Scenario: Quality gate integration
    Given I have tasks with quality requirements
    When I integrate quality gates
    Then each task should have:
      | gate_type       | criteria                       |
      | code_review     | Peer approval required         |
      | testing         | All tests passing              |
      | documentation   | Updates to relevant docs       |
      | security        | Security scan passing          |
    And gates should be enforced before task completion
    And gate failures should provide clear guidance
    And quality metrics should be tracked over time
