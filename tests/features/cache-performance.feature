Feature: Cache Performance and Hit Rate Optimization
  As a KGEN system
  I want to achieve ≥80% cache hit rate
  So that I can deliver optimal performance and reduce storage I/O

  Background:
    Given a KGEN caching system is initialized
    And cache metrics tracking is enabled
    And the target cache hit rate is set to 80%

  Scenario: Achieve target cache hit rate with typical workload
    Given a cache with 1000 slot capacity
    And a workload with 80% repeated content requests
    When 10000 content requests are processed
    Then the cache hit rate is ≥80%
    And cache miss rate is ≤20%
    And performance metrics are recorded

  Scenario: Cache warming with frequently accessed content
    Given an empty cache
    And a list of frequently accessed content hashes:
      | Hash     | Access Frequency |
      | hash1    | 100             |
      | hash2    | 85              |
      | hash3    | 70              |
    When cache warming is initiated
    Then frequently accessed content is preloaded
    And initial cache hit rate starts above baseline
    And cache utilization is optimized

  Scenario: Monitor cache hit rate in real-time
    Given cache is actively serving requests
    When cache metrics are collected every 5 seconds
    Then current hit rate is calculated and reported
    And hit rate trends are tracked over time
    And alerts trigger if hit rate drops below 75%

  Scenario: Cache performance under high load
    Given a cache system under high concurrent load
    When 1000 requests per second are processed
    Then cache hit rate remains ≥80%
    And response times stay within acceptable limits
    And system throughput is maintained

  Scenario: Optimize cache size for target hit rate
    Given varying cache sizes:
      | Cache Size | Expected Hit Rate |
      | 100 slots  | 60%              |
      | 500 slots  | 75%              |
      | 1000 slots | 82%              |
      | 2000 slots | 88%              |
    When workload is applied to each configuration
    Then optimal cache size for ≥80% hit rate is identified
    And resource allocation is optimized

  Scenario: Handle cache miss scenarios efficiently
    Given a cache miss occurs for content hash "missing123"
    When the content is requested
    Then the system fetches from underlying storage
    And content is added to cache for future hits
    And cache eviction policies are applied if needed
    And response time is minimized

  Scenario: Cache hit rate recovery after cold start
    Given a cold cache system startup
    When normal workload begins processing
    Then cache hit rate gradually improves
    And reaches ≥80% within specified time window
    And system performance stabilizes

  Scenario: Measure cache efficiency metrics
    Given cache operations are ongoing
    When performance metrics are collected
    Then the following metrics are tracked:
      | Metric                    | Target Value |
      | Hit Rate                 | ≥80%         |
      | Average Response Time    | <50ms        |
      | Cache Utilization        | 70-90%       |
      | Eviction Rate           | <10%         |
    And all metrics meet their targets

  Scenario: Cache performance with different content sizes
    Given cache stores content of varying sizes:
      | Content Type | Size Range | Access Pattern |
      | Small files  | <1KB      | High frequency |
      | Medium files | 1KB-100KB | Medium frequency |
      | Large files  | >100KB    | Low frequency |
    When mixed workload is processed
    Then overall cache hit rate is ≥80%
    And size-based caching strategies are effective

  Scenario: Geographic cache distribution performance
    Given multiple cache nodes in different regions
    When requests come from various geographic locations
    Then each regional cache maintains ≥80% hit rate
    And cross-region cache synchronization is efficient
    And global cache consistency is maintained

  Scenario: Cache hit rate with temporal access patterns
    Given content with time-based access patterns:
      | Time Window | Access Pattern     |
      | Peak hours  | High frequency     |
      | Off-peak    | Low frequency      |
      | Maintenance | Minimal access     |
    When workload varies by time
    Then cache adapts to temporal patterns
    And maintains ≥80% hit rate across all periods
    And cache resources are efficiently utilized
