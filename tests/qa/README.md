## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run Complete QA Suite
```bash
# Full comprehensive suite (includes mutation testing)
npm run qa:suite

# Fast mode (skips long-running tests like mutation testing)
npm run qa:suite:fast

# Individual components
npm run qa:quality-gates
npm run qa:coverage
npm run qa:security
npm run qa:dashboard
```

### Run Specific Test Types
```bash
# Performance testing
npm run test:performance

# End-to-end user journeys
npm run test:e2e

# Critical workflow validation
npm run test:workflows

# Mutation testing (slow)
npm run test:mutation
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
npm run qa:monitor

# Generate quality dashboard
npm run qa:dashboard

# Clean QA reports
npm run clean:qa
```

## üìä Quality Thresholds

The QA framework enforces the following quality thresholds:

| Metric | Threshold | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Code Coverage (Statements) | 80% | Minimum percentage of statements covered by tests |
| Code Coverage (Branches) | 75% | Minimum percentage of branches covered by tests |
| Performance (CLI Commands) | 5000ms | Maximum acceptable execution time |
| Security Vulnerabilities (Critical) | 0 | No critical security vulnerabilities allowed |
| Security Vulnerabilities (High) | 2 | Maximum 2 high-severity vulnerabilities |
| Mutation Score | 60% | Minimum percentage of mutations killed by tests |
| Quality Score | 70% | Overall quality score threshold |

## üìÅ Report Structure

All QA reports are saved to `tests/reports/`:

```
tests/reports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quality-gates.json          # Quality gate results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coverage-report.json        # Code coverage analysis

```

## üîß Configuration

### Quality Thresholds
Modify thresholds in individual QA components or create a central configuration file.

### Continuous Monitoring
Configure monitoring intervals and alert thresholds in `continuous-monitoring.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
  checkInterval: 300000, // 5 minutes
  thresholds: {
    coverageStatements: 80,
    performanceThreshold: 5000,
    qualityScore: 70
  },
  alerts: {
    email: 'team@example.com',
    webhook: 'https://hooks.slack.com/...',
  }
};
```

## üèóÔ∏è Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: QA Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  qa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run qa:suite:fast
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: qa-reports
          path: tests/reports/
```

### Pre-commit Hook Example
```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm run qa:quality-gates || exit 1
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Run QA Suite Before Commits**: Always run `npm run qa:suite:fast` before committing
2. **Monitor Trends**: Regularly check the quality dashboard for trends
3. **Address Security Issues**: Immediately fix critical and high-severity vulnerabilities
4. **Maintain Coverage**: Keep code coverage above 80%
5. **Performance Budget**: Monitor performance regressions
6. **Test Quality**: Use mutation testing to validate test effectiveness

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Coverage Too Low**: Add more unit tests, focus on untested branches
2. **Performance Regression**: Profile slow operations, optimize bottlenecks
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Run `npm audit fix`, update dependencies
4. **Mutation Score Low**: Add more assertions, test edge cases
5. **Build Failures**: Check build logs, fix compilation errors

### Debug Mode
Run individual QA components to isolate issues:
```bash
node tests/qa/security-scanner.js
node tests/qa/coverage-monitor.js
node tests/qa/performance-regression.js
```

## üìà Quality Score Calculation

The overall quality score is calculated as a weighted average:

- **Code Coverage**: 40% (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **Performance**: 20% (benchmark pass rate, execution times)
- **Workflows**: 20% (critical workflow success rate)
- **Security**: 15% (vulnerability count, severity)
- **Build**: 5% (build success rate)

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new QA components:

1. Follow the existing patterns and interfaces
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Include progress reporting
4. Generate both JSON and human-readable reports
5. Update this README with the new component
6. Add npm scripts for easy execution
