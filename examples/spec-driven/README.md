# Spec-Driven Development Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating the SPARC methodology for specification-driven development. Each example shows the complete flow from initial specification through to final implementation.

## Examples Overview

### 1. E-commerce Platform (`/ecommerce/`)
- **Domain**: Online retail system
- **Complexity**: High
- **Features**: Product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, order management
- **Architecture**: Microservices with event sourcing

### 2. User Management System (`/user-management/`)
- **Domain**: Authentication and authorization
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Features**: Registration, login, role-based access, profile management
- **Architecture**: Monolithic with clean architecture

### 3. API Gateway (`/api-gateway/`)
- **Domain**: Service orchestration and routing
- **Complexity**: High
- **Features**: Request routing, rate limiting, authentication, monitoring
- **Architecture**: Distributed gateway with circuit breakers

### 4. Microservice with Compliance (`/microservice/`)
- **Domain**: Financial data processing
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Features**: Data validation, audit logging, regulatory compliance
- **Architecture**: Single microservice with extensive monitoring

## SPARC Flow Structure

Each example follows this structure:

```

│   ├── 01-specification.md      # S: Requirements and constraints
│   ├── 02-pseudocode.md         # P: Algorithm design
│   ├── 03-architecture.md       # A: System design

│   └── 05-completion.md         # C: Integration and deployment

```

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Specification-First Development**: How to create actionable specs
- **SPARC Methodology**: Step-by-step systematic development
- **Test-Driven Design**: Writing tests before implementation
- **Architecture Patterns**: Common design patterns and their applications
- **Quality Assurance**: Code quality, security, and performance considerations

## Usage

Each example can be studied independently. Start with the `docs/01-specification.md` file in any example to understand the requirements, then follow the SPARC flow through to the final implementation.

## Implementation Notes

All examples use TypeScript/Node.js for consistency, but the patterns and methodologies apply to any technology stack. Focus on the process rather than the specific syntax.
