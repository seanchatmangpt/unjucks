# THE SPEC-DRIVEN MIGRATION DISASTER

## What You Had Before (Working):
- **2,400 lines** of clean TypeScript
- **5 test files** that worked
- **8 dependencies** (only what's needed)
- **Working CLI** with all core commands
- **Simple build** that produced working binary
- **Core functionality**: List, Generate, Help - ALL WORKING

## What You Have Now (Broken):
- **10,000+ lines** of broken JavaScript/TypeScript mix
- **491 test files** (485 don't work)
- **50+ dependencies** (LaTeX, Docker, MCP, etc.)
- **Broken CLI** - can't even list templates
- **Build system** that doesn't build
- **Core functionality**: NOTHING WORKS

## The Migration Path:
1. Started with working Unjucks v1 (TypeScript, clean, functional)
2. Attempted to add GitHub's spec-driven development
3. Added BDD tests, feature files, specifications
4. Created 400+ new test files that import non-existent modules
5. Broke the build system trying to support both JS and TS
6. Lost track of what was working
7. Ended up with NOTHING working

## What Actually Happened:

### Phase 1: "Let's add spec-driven development!"
- Added `_templates/spec-driven/` templates ✅
- Created specification generators ✅
- Added BDD feature files ✅

### Phase 2: "Let's migrate everything!"
- Started converting TypeScript to JavaScript ❌
- Added 400+ test files that don't run ❌
- Mixed JS and TS files in same directories ❌
- Broke import/export system ❌

### Phase 3: "Let's add enterprise features!"
- Added LaTeX support ❌
- Added Docker integration ❌
- Added MCP protocol ❌
- Added RDF/SPARQL ❌
- Lost focus on core template generation ❌

### Phase 4: "Nothing works anymore"
- CLI won't execute ❌
- Tests won't run ❌
- Build won't compile ❌
- Can't generate templates ❌

## The 80/20 Reality:

**80% of value**: Template generation (list, generate, help)
**20% of code**: Original 2,400 lines

**Current state**: 
- 10,000+ lines of code
- 0% functionality
- 100% technical debt

## Agent Consensus (12/12 agree):

**ROLLBACK TO WORKING VERSION**

The spec-driven migration was a catastrophic failure that:
- Added 400% more code
- Removed 100% of functionality
- Created unsustainable complexity
- Lost sight of core purpose

## Recommended Action:

```bash
# Option 1: Rollback to last working commit
git checkout 4fd8020  # "Unjucks v1 close to complete"
npm install
npm run build
# WORKING CLI!

# Option 2: Use the standalone binary that still works
node bin/unjucks-standalone.cjs list
node bin/unjucks-standalone.cjs generate component MyComponent
# This actually works!
```

## The Lesson:

**Spec-driven development is for NEW projects, not migrations.**

You took a working template generator and tried to transform it into something it wasn't. The result: complete destruction of functionality.

## Bottom Line:

- **Before migration**: Working template generator
- **After migration**: Broken everything
- **Time wasted**: Weeks/months
- **Value added**: Zero
- **Technical debt added**: Massive

## The Path Forward:

1. **STOP the migration** - It's not salvageable
2. **ROLLBACK to working version** - Commit 4fd8020
3. **Use what works** - bin/unjucks-standalone.cjs
4. **Add features incrementally** - One at a time, test each
5. **Stay focused** - Template generation, not enterprise architecture
