## 🔍 Universal Problems (ALL Commits):

### Missing Files Blocking Everything:
- `src/lib/fast-version-resolver.js` - Breaks main CLI
- `src/lib/latex/build-integration.js` - Breaks build system

### What Actually Works:
- **ONLY** `bin/unjucks-standalone.cjs` works consistently
- Template discovery (finding generators)
- Basic test infrastructure (when not disabled)

## 📊 Functionality Breakdown:

| Commit | Tests | Build | Main CLI | Standalone | Templates | Score |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|------------|-----------|--------|
| 7b932ce | ✅ 100% | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ List only | 62/100 |
| 91fac78 | ✅ 100% | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 42/100 |
| 700cc1e | ❌ Disabled | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ List only | 45/100 |
| b8e6de0 | ❌ Disabled | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 25/100 |

## 🚨 The Truth:

**The project got progressively WORSE over time:**
- Started with ambitious goals
- Added complex features without testing
- Broke core functionality
- Never fixed the basics
- Added more complexity to hide problems

## 💡 Agent Consensus:

All 12 agents agree:
1. **No commit is production-ready**
2. **Standalone CLI is the only working component**
3. **Build system broken everywhere**
4. **Tests were disabled to hide failures**
5. **Template generation broken despite discovery working**

## 🎯 Recommendation:

### Option 1: Use Commit 7b932ce + Fixes
```bash
git checkout 7b932ce
# Fix the two missing files
# Use standalone CLI
```

### Option 2: Stay on Current + Use Standalone
```bash
# Just use what works now:
node bin/unjucks-standalone.cjs list
node bin/unjucks-standalone.cjs generate component MyComponent
```

### Option 3: Find an Older Working Version
```bash
# Go back further than 10 commits
git log --oneline -50 | grep -i "working\|stable\|release"
# Find when it actually worked
```

## Bottom Line:

**Best of the bad options: Commit 7b932ce**
- Has most components "attempting" to work
- Tests actually run and pass
- Standalone CLI functional

But truthfully, the project needs:
1. Fix the two missing files
2. Re-enable tests
3. Fix build system
4. Test before claiming "production ready"
