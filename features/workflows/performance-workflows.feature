Feature: System-Wide Performance Validation Workflows
  As a KGEN performance engineer
  I want comprehensive performance validation across the entire system
  So that all charter KPIs are met under real-world conditions

  Background:
    Given KGEN system is configured for performance testing
    And comprehensive performance monitoring is enabled
    And the following charter KPIs must be validated:
      | metric                    | requirement | measurement_method | critical |
      | reproducibility_rate      | ≥99.9%      | statistical_analysis| yes     |
      | provenance_coverage       | 100%        | graph_completeness  | yes     |
      | cache_hit_rate           | ≥80%        | cache_statistics    | no      |
      | p95_response_time        | ≤150ms      | latency_distribution| no      |
      | drift_snr                | ≥90%        | drift_detection     | no      |
    And performance baseline is established from previous measurements
    And load testing infrastructure is available

  @kpi-validation @reproducibility

    Given 1000 identical generation requests are prepared
    And each request uses the same RDF input and templates
    And deterministic generation settings are configured
    And concurrent execution is enabled with 50 parallel workers
