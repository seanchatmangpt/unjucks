Feature: Validation Error Reporting and Remediation
  As a KGEN developer
  I want comprehensive validation error reports with actionable fixes
  So that I can quickly identify and resolve data quality issues

  Background:
    Given KGEN validation reporting system is available
    And validation reports support JSON format by default
    And error reporting includes detailed diagnostics
    And performance target for report generation is "â‰¤5ms"

  @reporting @basic
  Scenario: Generate basic validation violation report
    Given I have validation results with violations
    When I generate a validation report
    Then the report should include:
      | field                    | type    | description                     |
      | conforms                 | boolean | Overall validation success      |
      | timestamp               | string  | ISO 8601 validation timestamp   |
      | violations              | array   | List of violation objects       |
      | summary                 | object  | Aggregated validation summary   |
    And the report should be valid JSON
    And report generation should complete within "5ms"

  @reporting @detailed-violations
  Scenario: Report detailed violation information
    Given I have SHACL validation violations from constraint checking
    When I generate a detailed violation report
    Then each violation should include:
      | field                      | description                                |
      | focusNode                  | The RDF node that failed validation       |
      | resultPath                 | The property path that caused the violation|
      | sourceConstraintComponent  | The SHACL constraint that was violated    |
      | sourceShape                | The SHACL shape containing the constraint |
      | severity                   | Violation severity (Violation/Warning/Info)|
      | message                    | Human-readable error message              |
      | value                      | The actual value that caused the violation |
    And violations should be sorted by severity and focus node
    And violation messages should be actionable

  @reporting @aggregated-summary
  Scenario: Provide aggregated validation summary
    Given I have validation results with multiple violations
    When I generate a validation summary
    Then the summary should include:
      | field                       | description                         |

      | table  | Human-readable table format   |
      | csv    | Comma-separated values         |
      | html   | Web-friendly HTML report       |
    Then each format should contain the same core information
    And format-specific optimizations should be applied
    And all formats should be well-formed according to their specifications

  @reporting @severity-filtering
  Scenario: Filter violations by severity level
    Given I have validation results with mixed severity violations:
      | severity  | count |
      | Violation | 5     |
      | Warning   | 8     |
      | Info      | 12    |
    When I generate reports filtered by severity:
      | filter        | expected_count |
      | violations    | 5              |
      | warnings      | 8              |

      | non-info      | 13             |
    Then filtered reports should contain only matching violations
    And summary statistics should reflect the filter
    And filtering should not affect performance significantly
