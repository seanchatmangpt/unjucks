# 1. Executive Summary

## 1.1 Vision Statement

Unjucks v2 represents a paradigm shift in code generation and scaffolding, moving from simple template processing to intelligent, specification-driven development. It empowers development teams to generate consistent, high-quality code at scale while maintaining flexibility and developer productivity.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Modern software development faces several critical challenges in code generation and scaffolding:

1. **Inconsistency**: Manual code creation leads to inconsistent patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches across teams and projects.

2. **Repetitive Work**: Developers spend significant time writing boilerplate code, following established patterns, and implementing similar functionality across different parts of applications.

3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Architectural decisions and coding patterns exist in developers' minds rather than being codified and transferable.

4. **Specification Drift**: Requirements and specifications become outdated as implementation diverges from original design documents.

5. **Scalability Issues**: Traditional scaffolding tools don't scale well for large teams or complex enterprise applications.

### Market Analysis
The code generation market has seen significant growth, with tools like Yeoman, Plop, and Hygen gaining adoption. However, these tools have limitations:

- **Limited Intelligence**: Most tools are template-based without understanding of context or best practices
- **Poor Integration**: Lack of integration with modern AI tools and development workflows
