# TypeScript Error: Missing Type Definitions

## Issue
**File:** `tests/tsconfig.json`  
**Error:** Cannot find type definition file for '@cucumber/cucumber'

## Root Cause
The TypeScript configuration is trying to include type definitions for `@cucumber/cucumber` but the type definitions are not installed or not found in the expected location.

## Potential Fixes

### Option 1: Install Missing Type Definitions (Recommended)
- Install the Cucumber type definitions:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/cucumber
# or
pnpm add -D @types/cucumber
```

### Option 2: Check Package Installation
- Verify that `@cucumber/cucumber` is properly installed
- Check if the package provides its own TypeScript definitions
- Update to latest version if needed

### Option 3: Configure TypeScript to Skip Missing Types
- Add `skipLibCheck: true` to `tsconfig.json`
- This skips type checking for declaration files

### Option 4: Remove Cucumber from TypeScript Config
- Remove `@cucumber/cucumber` from `compilerOptions.types` if not needed
- Only include types that are actually used

### Option 5: Use Module Resolution
- Add proper module resolution configuration
- Ensure TypeScript can find the package types

## Impact Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Missing type definitions don't affect runtime
- **Development Experience:** Affects IDE support and type checking
- **Test Configuration:** Related to test setup, not production code

## Recommendation
Use Option 1 (install type definitions) as it provides proper type safety and IDE support for Cucumber testing.
