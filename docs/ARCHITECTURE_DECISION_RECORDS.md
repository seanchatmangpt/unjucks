# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Dependency Management Strategy
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Architecture Team

### Context
The project currently has deleted package-lock.json and relies on backup node_modules, creating security and reproducibility risks.

### Decision
Implement strict dependency management with:
- Restored package-lock.json with verified dependency versions
- Monthly dependency audits and security scans
- Dependency approval process for new packages
- Lock file version control enforcement

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Reproducible builds, security compliance, supply chain protection
- **Negative**: Slower dependency updates, additional process overhead

**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Architecture Team

### Context
Project has 44+ configuration files creating operational complexity and maintenance burden.

### Decision
Consolidate to unified configuration system:
```
config/
├── base.config.js          # Base configuration
├── environments/
│   ├── development.js      # Dev overrides
│   ├── testing.js          # Test overrides
│   └── production.js       # Prod overrides
└── features/
    ├── database.js         # DB configuration
    ├── security.js         # Security settings
    └── performance.js      # Performance tuning
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Easier maintenance, consistent configuration, clearer environment management
- **Negative**: Migration effort, potential breaking changes during transition

## ADR-003: Logging and Monitoring Strategy
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Architecture Team

### Context
150+ files contain console logging, violating production readiness and security standards.

### Decision
Implement structured logging system:
- Replace all console.log with structured logger (Winston/Pino)
- Implement log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
- Add request correlation IDs
- Implement log aggregation for enterprise deployment

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Production-ready logging, security compliance, debugging capabilities
- **Negative**: Code refactoring effort, logging infrastructure requirements

## ADR-004: Modular Architecture Pattern
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Architecture Team

### Context
Large files (2000+ lines), tight coupling (217 relative imports), and god objects violate maintainability principles.

### Decision
Implement Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts:
```
src/
├── domains/
│   ├── template-generation/
│   ├── knowledge-management/
│   ├── security-management/
│   └── workflow-orchestration/
├── shared/
│   ├── infrastructure/
│   ├── common/
│   └── types/
└── interfaces/
    ├── cli/
    ├── api/
    └── web/
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better maintainability, clear boundaries, testability, team scalability
- **Negative**: Initial refactoring complexity, learning curve for team

---

## ADR-005: State Management Architecture
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Architecture Team

### Context
Current in-memory caching and stateful design prevents horizontal scaling required for enterprise deployment.

### Decision
Implement stateless architecture with external state management:
- Redis for session and cache management
- PostgreSQL for persistent data
- Event-driven architecture for cross-service communication
- Implement CQRS pattern for read/write separation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Horizontal scalability, high availability, enterprise-grade performance
- **Negative**: Infrastructure complexity, operational overhead, development complexity

---

## ADR-006: Security Architecture
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Security Team

### Context
While security modules exist, missing centralized secrets management, audit logging, and compliance frameworks.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive security architecture:
- HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
- Structured audit logging with tamper detection
- OAuth2/OIDC for authentication and authorization
- Regular security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Zero-trust network architecture

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enterprise security compliance, audit readiness, regulatory compliance
- **Negative**: Infrastructure costs, complexity, performance overhead

---

## ADR-007: Testing Strategy Standardization
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Quality Assurance Team

### Context
Multiple testing frameworks, 10+ test configurations, scattered test organization creates maintenance burden.

### Decision
Standardize on unified testing approach:
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- Single test configuration with environment overrides
- Test-driven development practices
- Contract testing for API boundaries

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent testing, easier maintenance, better coverage reporting
- **Negative**: Migration effort, team training requirements

---

## ADR-008: Performance Monitoring and SLAs
**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Decision Maker:** Operations Team

### Context
No defined performance SLAs, limited monitoring, unclear capacity planning for enterprise scale.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive performance monitoring:
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) with Datadog/New Relic
- Define SLAs: 99.9% uptime, <200ms p95 response time, <5s p99
- Implement circuit breakers and rate limiting
- Automated performance testing in CI/CD
- Capacity planning and auto-scaling

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Proactive issue detection, performance guarantees, enterprise SLA compliance
- **Negative**: Monitoring costs, alerting overhead, performance optimization complexity
