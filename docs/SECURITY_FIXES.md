# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Path Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Template Variable Processing Security
- **Issue**: Template variables could potentially execute arbitrary code
- **Fix**: Enhanced variable processing with proper escaping for EJS-style (`<%= %>`) and Nunjucks (`{{ }}`) variables
- **Impact**: Prevents template injection attacks

### 2. Filter Registration Security
- **Issue**: LaTeX filters not properly registered, potentially allowing unsafe content
- **Fix**: Proper registration of LaTeX filters with escaping mechanisms
- **Impact**: Safe LaTeX content generation

### 3. Template Discovery Security
- **Issue**: Potential path traversal in template discovery
- **Fix**: Restricted template discovery to known safe paths (project root and node_modules/@seanchatmangpt/unjucks)
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized file access

### 4. Error Message Information Disclosure
- **Issue**: Error messages could expose sensitive file paths
- **Fix**: Sanitized error messages to show only relevant, safe information
- **Impact**: Reduces information leakage

## Dependency Vulnerabilities

### Critical Dependencies (Production)
All critical production dependencies are secure for the intended use case:
- `chalk`: Used only for terminal output formatting
- `citty`: CLI framework, latest stable version
- `consola`: Logger, latest stable version
- `fs-extra`: File operations, properly sandboxed
- `nunjucks`: Template engine, used with proper escaping

### Development Dependencies
Several development dependencies have vulnerabilities but do not affect production:
- `eslint`, `vitest`, `puppeteer`: Only used during development
- These do not ship with the package

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Path Restriction**: File operations restricted to safe directories
3. **Template Escaping**: All template variables properly escaped
4. **Error Handling**: Sensitive information removed from error messages
5. **Dependency Management**: Production dependencies kept minimal and secure

## Recommendations

1. Regularly update dependencies using `npm audit`
2. Use `--production` flag when installing in production
3. Keep development environment separate from production
4. Monitor security advisories for used packages

## Testing

All security fixes have been tested with:
- Template generation with various variable formats
- Error conditions with sensitive paths
- LaTeX generation with special characters
- Export functionality with user inputs

## Next Steps

Continue monitoring:
- npm audit reports
- GitHub security advisories
- Dependency updates
- Community security reports
