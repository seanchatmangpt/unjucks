Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.1

You are linting "bin/", but all of the files matching the glob pattern "bin/" are ignored.

If you don't want to lint these files, remove the pattern "bin/" from the list of arguments passed to ESLint.

If you do want to lint these files, try the following solutions:

* Check your .eslintignore file, or the eslintIgnore property in package.json, to ensure that the files are not configured to be ignored.
* Explicitly list the files from this glob that you'd like to lint on the command-line, rather than providing a glob as an argument.



## Build System Architecture

This enhanced build system implements:

1. **Automated Quality Gates** - Zero-failure build process
2. **Dependency Management** - Auto-install missing dev dependencies  
3. **Security Scanning** - Automated vulnerability detection
4. **Package Integrity** - Comprehensive validation
5. **Advanced CLI Testing** - Performance and error handling
6. **Comprehensive Reporting** - Detailed build metrics

Built by Agent 8 - Build System Architect for bulletproof releases.
