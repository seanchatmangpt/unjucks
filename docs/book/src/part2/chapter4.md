COPY .devcontainer/ai-config.json /workspace/
```

## Multi-Agent Development Platforms

### Claude Flow Integration

#### Swarm Initialization
```bash
# Initialize development swarm
npx claude-flow swarm init --topology mesh --max-agents 8
```

#### Agent Coordination
```javascript
// Multi-agent workflow coordination
const workflow = {
    agents: [
        { type: "researcher", capabilities: ["analysis", "documentation"] },
        { type: "coder", capabilities: ["implementation", "testing"] },
        { type: "reviewer", capabilities: ["quality", "security"] }
    ],
    coordination: "mesh",
    communication: "memory-based"
};
```

### Custom Multi-Agent Frameworks

#### Agent Definition
```typescript
interface DevelopmentAgent {
    id: string;
    type: AgentType;
    capabilities: string[];
    coordinationPattern: CoordinationPattern;
    memoryAccess: MemoryAccessPattern;
}
```

#### Workflow Orchestration
```typescript
class AgentOrchestrator {
    async coordinateAgents(task: DevelopmentTask): Promise<Result> {
        const agents = this.selectAgents(task);
        return await this.executeCoordinated(agents, task);
    }
}
```

## AI Tool Integration Patterns

### Sequential Integration

#### Traditional Workflow Enhancement
```
Requirements → AI Analysis → Specification
Specification → AI Generation → Implementation  
Implementation → AI Testing → Validation
```

### Parallel Integration

#### Multi-Agent Coordination
```
Requirements Analysis (Agent 1) ←→ Architecture Design (Agent 2)
                ↓                           ↓
Implementation (Agent 3) ←→ Testing & Validation (Agent 4)
```

### Iterative Integration

#### Continuous AI Assistance
```
Code → AI Review → Refinement → AI Optimization → Deployment
  ↑                                                    ↓
  ←←←← Feedback Loop ←←←← Monitoring ←←←←
```
