# Glossary

## A

**AI Agent**: Specialized artificial intelligence assistants designed for specific development tasks such as code generation, testing, or review.

**Architecture Pattern**: Established structural solutions for organizing software components and their interactions.

## B

**Boilerplate Code**: Repetitive code that must be included in many places with little or no alteration.

## C

**CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Text-based interface for interacting with software programs through commands.

**Code Generation**: The automated creation of source code based on templates, models, or specifications.

**Context**: The environmental information and variables available to templates during generation, including project settings, file structure, and user-provided data.

## D

**Declarative Programming**: Programming paradigm that focuses on describing what should be accomplished rather than how to accomplish it.

**DX (Developer Experience)**: The overall experience developers have when using tools, frameworks, and development environments.

**Dry Run**: Executing a command or process in a simulation mode to preview results without making actual changes.

## E

**ESM (ECMAScript Modules)**: The official standard for JavaScript modules, providing import/export functionality.

## F

**Frontmatter**: YAML metadata placed at the beginning of template files to configure generation behavior.

**Framework**: A platform providing structure and pre-written code to support application development.

## G

**Generator**: A collection of templates and configuration that work together to produce related code files.

## H

**Hygen**: A popular code generation tool that inspired aspects of Unjucks design.

**Hot Reload**: Automatic refresh of applications when source code changes are detected.

## I

**Injection**: The process of intelligently adding content to existing files without overwriting or duplicating code.

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: Software application providing comprehensive facilities for software development.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: Lightweight data interchange format widely used for configuration and data exchange.

## L

**Linting**: Static analysis of code to identify potential errors, style issues, and suspicious constructs.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Communication protocol for AI agents to share context and coordinate activities.

**Multi-Agent System**: Coordinated network of AI agents working together to accomplish complex development tasks.

## N

**Nunjucks**: The templating engine that powers Unjucks, providing rich template syntax and features.

**npm**: Node.js package manager for installing and managing JavaScript libraries and tools.

## P

**Package.json**: Configuration file for Node.js projects defining dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

**Pseudocode**: Informal high-level description of programming logic using natural language conventions.

## S

**Scaffolding**: Automated generation of basic project structure and boilerplate code.

**SPARC**: Methodology for AI-assisted development (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion).

**Semantic Web**: Extension of the web with machine-readable data and standardized formats.

## T

**Template**: A file containing both static content and dynamic placeholders that generate customized output.

**Template Engine**: Software component that combines templates with data to produce formatted output.

**TypeScript**: Statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## U

**Unjucks**: Modern code generation framework built on Nunjucks templating with frontmatter configuration.

## V

**Variables**: Named values that can be substituted into templates during the generation process.

## W

**Workflow**: Sequence of automated steps in the development process, often orchestrated by AI agents.

## Y

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**: Human-readable data serialization standard commonly used for configuration files.
