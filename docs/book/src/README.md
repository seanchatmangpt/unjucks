## Welcome to the Future of Code Generation 🚀

Unjucks represents a **quantum leap** in code generation technology, combining the reliability of established patterns with cutting-edge innovations that set it apart from traditional tools like Hygen and other scaffolding solutions.

### What Makes Unjucks Revolutionary?

**🧠 AI-First Architecture**: The world's first code generator with native Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, enabling direct AI assistant access and semantic-aware agent coordination.

**⚡ Semantic Web Integration**: Production-ready N3/Turtle/RDF support allows templates to reason with enterprise knowledge graphs and ontologies at Fortune 5 scale.

**🏗️ Advanced File Operations**: Six sophisticated operation modes (write, inject, append, prepend, lineAt, conditional) with idempotent safety and atomic transactions.

**🔧 Nunjucks Template Engine**: Full-featured template inheritance, macros, 40+ built-in filters, and complex conditional logic - far beyond EJS limitations.

**🛡️ Enterprise Security**: Zero-trust architecture with path traversal protection, input sanitization, YAML security, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Quick Start: 5-Minute Transformation

```bash
# Install Unjucks globally
npm install -g unjucks

# Initialize with AI-powered templates
unjucks init react my-enterprise-app --withMCP --withSemantics

# Generate a complete microservice with compliance
unjucks generate fortune5/microservice user-service \
  --databaseType postgresql \
  --authProvider oauth2 \
  --complianceMode soc2 \
  --dest ./services/user-service

# Enable AI assistant integration
unjucks mcp enable

# Now Claude can generate code through natural language!
# "Create a REST API for user management with JWT auth and PostgreSQL"
```
