Phase 3: Complete architecture before moving to Phase 4
Phase 4: Complete refinement before moving to Phase 5
Phase 5: Complete deployment and integration
```

### Iterative Implementation
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 1 (revision) → Phase 2 (update)
Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 2 (revision) → Phase 3 (update)
...continuing with validation and refinement cycles
