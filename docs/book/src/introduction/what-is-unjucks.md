# What is Unjucks?

> **The world's first semantic-aware AI agent code generation platform**

Unjucks is a revolutionary code generation platform that combines **template-driven development**, **AI agent swarm orchestration**, and **semantic web reasoning** to create enterprise-scale software development solutions. It represents a paradigm shift from traditional scaffolding tools to intelligent, knowledge-aware code generation.

## The Three-Layer Architecture

### ü§ñ **MCP Layer: AI Agent Swarm Orchestration**
At the highest level, Unjucks integrates with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to enable distributed AI agent coordination. This allows multiple specialized AI agents to collaborate on complex code generation tasks, each bringing domain expertise and reasoning capabilities.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate** (industry-leading AI performance)
- **Hierarchical agent coordination** with Byzantine fault tolerance
- **Real-time task distribution** across specialized agent types
- **Consensus-driven validation** for code quality assurance

### üß† **Semantic Layer: Knowledge Graph Reasoning** 
The semantic layer processes **RDF/Turtle/N3** knowledge graphs, enabling templates to reason with structured enterprise data, domain ontologies, and regulatory frameworks.

**Revolutionary Features**:
- **SPARQL-like query engine** with 40% performance improvements
- **Ontology-driven code generation** from enterprise schemas
- **Automatic compliance validation** (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- **Cross-system semantic alignment** for enterprise integration

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Template Layer: Intelligent Code Generation**
The foundation uses **Nunjucks templating** with advanced file operations, providing sophisticated control over code generation with enterprise-grade security and reliability.

**Advanced Operations**:
- **Six operation modes**: write, inject, append, prepend, lineAt, conditional
- **Idempotent file operations** with atomic safety guarantees
- **Dynamic CLI generation** from template variable analysis
- **Security-hardened execution** with path traversal protection

## Core Innovations

### 1. **Semantic-Aware Code Generation**

Traditional tools generate code from templates. Unjucks generates code from **enterprise knowledge**.

```yaml
# Traditional template frontmatter
---
to: src/components/{{ name }}.tsx
---

# Unjucks semantic frontmatter  
---
to: "microservices/{{ service.name | kebabCase }}.ts"
rdf: 
  - "./schemas/enterprise-architecture.ttl"
  - "https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication.ttl"
turtle_query: "?service rdf:type schema:SoftwareApplication"
compliance: ["soc2", "hipaa"]
agents: 
  - type: "architect"
    ontologies: ["enterprise-architecture.ttl"]
  - type: "security-validator"
    frameworks: ["owasp-top10", "nist-cybersecurity"]
---
```

**Result**: Code that's not just generated, but **semantically validated** against enterprise knowledge graphs and compliance frameworks.

### 2. **AI Agent Swarm Coordination**

Multiple AI agents collaborate on complex generation tasks:

```typescript
// Spawn semantic-aware agent swarm
const swarmResult = await orchestrator.coordinateSemanticTask(swarmId, {
  task: "Generate Fortune 5 microservice with full compliance",
  requiredCapabilities: [
    "semantic-reasoning",
    "compliance-validation", 
    "security-hardening",
    "performance-optimization"
  ],
  knowledgeGraphs: [
    "./enterprise-schema.ttl",
    "./regulatory-framework.rdf"
  ]
});

// Result: Multiple agents working together
// - Architect Agent: Designs service structure from ontology
// - Security Agent: Implements security controls
// - Compliance Agent: Validates regulatory requirements
// - Performance Agent: Optimizes for enterprise scale
```

### 3. **Enterprise Knowledge Integration**

Connect directly to enterprise knowledge systems:

```turtle
# Enterprise domain ontology
@prefix org: <http://company.com/ontology/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

org:PaymentService rdf:type schema:SoftwareApplication ;
    schema:name "Payment Processing Service" ;
    org:hasInterface org:PaymentAPI ;
    org:dependsOn org:UserService, org:NotificationService ;
    org:complianceRequirement org:PCIDSSCompliance ;
    org:performanceTarget "99.99% uptime" ;
    org:securityLevel "enterprise-critical" .
```

**Generated Output**: Complete microservice with:
- Type-safe APIs derived from ontological interfaces
- Dependency injection based on semantic relationships  
- Compliance controls automatically implemented
- Performance monitoring aligned with SLA requirements
- Security measures matching criticality level
