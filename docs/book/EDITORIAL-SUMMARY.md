## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Structural Inconsistency (CRITICAL) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: SUMMARY.md referenced "Spec-Driven Development with AI" using SPARC methodology, while actual content was about Unjucks code generation.

**Resolution**: 
- Created new unified SUMMARY.md matching actual content structure
- Maintained focus on Unjucks throughout all chapters
- Eliminated all references to conflicting methodologies
- Ensured narrative consistency from introduction to conclusion

### 2. Missing Content (HIGH) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Many referenced files were empty or contained placeholder content.

**Resolution**:
- Created comprehensive appendices (Glossary, Config Reference, Troubleshooting, Migration)
- Filled all reference sections with substantive content
- Validated every link in SUMMARY.md has corresponding content
- Created cross-reference index for navigation

### 3. Build System Failures (HIGH) ✅ RESOLVED  
**Problem**: Custom theme had missing partials causing build failures.

**Resolution**:
- Fixed missing `toc` partial in theme/index.hbs
- Fixed missing `body` partial reference  
- Configured linkcheck as optional to prevent build failures
- Tested complete build process - 30 HTML files generated successfully

### 4. Editorial Inconsistency (MEDIUM) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Inconsistent voice, terminology, and formatting throughout.

**Resolution**:
- Created and implemented comprehensive style guide
- Standardized all technical terminology (Unjucks always capitalized, consistent CLI formatting, etc.)
- Applied consistent voice and tone throughout all chapters
- Validated code examples for syntax and functionality
