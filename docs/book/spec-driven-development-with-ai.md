## Sample Chapter Excerpt

### Chapter 5: Writing Your First Specification (excerpt)

*The morning we decided to rebuild Unjucks v2 using specifications, our lead developer Sarah looked at the whiteboard covered in architectural diagrams and said, "We're going to need a bigger boat." She was right. The legacy system had 48 generators, 200+ templates, and only 57% test coverage. But instead of a bigger boat, we needed a better map.*

*We started with a simple question: "What does Unjucks actually need to do?" Not what it currently did—with all its accidental complexity and historical baggage—but what it needed to do to serve our users.*

```yaml
# Our first attempt at the core specification
name: Unjucks Template Engine
purpose: Generate code from templates with variable substitution
core_features:
  - template_discovery: Find all available templates
  - variable_processing: Replace {{variables}} with values  
  - file_generation: Create files in specified locations
```

*It seemed too simple. Where were the 65+ filters? The RDF processing? The LaTeX support? This is where specification-driven development taught us our first lesson: Start with the essential, add the complex.*

*By the end of that first day, we had a 10-page specification that captured more clarity about Unjucks than 50,000 lines of code ever had. The template discovery that had been scattered across seven files and three abstractions became a single, clear requirement:*

```yaml
requirement:
  id: F001
  title: Template Discovery
  rationale: Users need to know what templates are available
  acceptance_criteria:
    - MUST scan _templates directory recursively
    - MUST complete in <100ms for up to 1000 templates
    - MUST support .njk, .ejs, and .hbs extensions
    - MUST cache results with 10-minute TTL
    - MUST handle missing directories gracefully
```

*This specification became our North Star. Every line of code we wrote traced back to it. When arguments arose about implementation details, we returned to the spec. When AI agents needed guidance, we pointed them to the spec. When new developers joined, they read the spec.*

## Marketing Hook

"How do you rebuild a 50,000-line codebase with 57% test coverage into a robust, maintainable system with 96% test coverage in 12 weeks? You don't start with code—you start with specifications. This is the story of how we used GitHub's Spec Kit methodology and AI swarms to transform Unjucks from a legacy nightmare into a modern, extensible platform. And how you can do the same."
