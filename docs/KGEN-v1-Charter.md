# KGEN v1 Project Charter
## DfLLSS: Declarative, Deterministic, Layered Logic for Semantic Software

**Project**: KGEN v1 - Knowledge Graph Engine for Deterministic Artifact Generation  
**Charter Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2024-12-01  
**Status**: Active Development  

### Executive Summary

KGEN v1 implements a **Declarative, Deterministic, Layered Logic for Semantic Software (DfLLSS)** framework that addresses critical challenges in modern software development:

- **Provenance Crisis**: Software artifacts lack verifiable lineage and reproducible generation
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Domain expertise scattered across undocumented, ad-hoc processes
- **Non-Deterministic Generation**: Template-based code generation produces inconsistent results
- **Validation Complexity**: No standardized approach to verify artifact correctness and compliance

### Mission Statement

To create a git-first, deterministic artifact generation system that ensures **complete provenance**, **semantic validation**, and **reproducible builds** for all generated software artifacts.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Declarative Design
- All generation rules expressed as RDF graphs and SHACL shapes
- No imperative code in artifact generation pipeline  
- Configuration-driven template selection and variable binding
- Policy enforcement through machine-readable governance rules

#### 2. Deterministic Execution
- Static build times ensure bit-for-bit reproducibility
- Content-addressed storage prevents drift
- Cryptographic attestations provide tamper evidence
- Canonical serialization eliminates representation variations

#### 3. Layered Architecture
- **Layer 1**: RDF Knowledge Graphs (semantic data model)
- **Layer 2**: SHACL Validation (constraint enforcement)  
- **Layer 3**: Nunjucks Templates (deterministic rendering)
- **Layer 4**: Git Storage (provenance and distribution)

#### 4. Semantic Enrichment
- Domain knowledge captured in machine-readable ontologies
- Reasoning rules derive implicit relationships and constraints
- SPARQL queries enable sophisticated artifact generation patterns
- Semantic validation ensures consistency across knowledge domains

### Architecture Overview

#### Git-First Storage Model
```
.git/objects/           # Content-addressed artifact storage
.git/notes/             # Cryptographic attestations and metadata  
.kgen/state/            # Drift detection baselines
.kgen/cache/            # Template compilation cache
knowledge/              # RDF graphs and ontologies
rules/                  # SHACL shapes and N3 reasoning rules
_templates/             # Nunjucks template library
```

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Graph Ingestion**: Parse RDF knowledge graphs with enhanced semantic processing
2. **Schema Validation**: Apply SHACL constraints to ensure data integrity  
3. **Context Enrichment**: Execute reasoning rules to derive additional facts
4. **Template Resolution**: Select appropriate templates based on graph patterns
5. **Deterministic Rendering**: Generate artifacts with static timestamps and canonical serialization
6. **Attestation Creation**: Generate cryptographic proofs of generation process
7. **Git Integration**: Store artifacts as addressable blobs with provenance metadata

#### Performance Targets
- **Cold Start**: â‰¤ 2s for CLI initialization
- **Template Rendering**: â‰¤ 150ms p95 for typical artifacts  
- **Cache Hit Rate**: â‰¥ 80% for repeated operations
- **Memory Usage**: â‰¤ 512MB for standard workloads

### Technology Stack

#### Core Dependencies
- **RDF Processing**: N3.js for graph manipulation and reasoning
- **Validation**: SHACL-Engine for constraint validation
- **Templating**: Nunjucks for deterministic rendering
- **Configuration**: c12 for layered configuration management
- **CLI Framework**: Citty for command-line interface
- **Git Integration**: isomorphic-git for git-first operations

#### Cryptographic Components

- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for attestation signing
- **Encoding**: Multiformats for content identifiers

### Key Features

#### 1. Graph Operations
```bash
kgen graph hash knowledge/domain.ttl

```

#### 2. Deterministic Artifact Generation

kgen artifact generate --graph knowledge/api.ttl --template rest-api
kgen artifact drift ./generated
kgen artifact explain ./generated/api.ts
```

#### 3. Project Lifecycle Management
```bash
kgen project lock
kgen project attest
```

#### 4. Template Discovery and Management
```bash  
kgen templates ls --verbose
kgen templates show rest-api
```

#### 5. Validation Framework
```bash
kgen validate artifacts ./generated --shapes-file rules/api-shapes.ttl
kgen validate graph knowledge/domain.ttl --shacl
kgen validate provenance ./generated/api.ts
```
