- `.secrets.act` - Dummy secrets for local testing
- `docker-compose.act.yml` - Local service dependencies

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability

#### Enterprise Monitoring Levels
1. **Basic** - Health checks, basic metrics
2. **Standard** - Application metrics, logging
3. **Enhanced** - Performance monitoring, alerting
4. **Comprehensive** - Full APM, distributed tracing
5. **Enterprise** - Business metrics, compliance tracking

#### Real-time Alerting
```yaml
alerts:
  - high-error-rate: error_rate > 1% → Critical → Slack + PagerDuty
  - slow-response: avg_response > 500ms → Warning → Slack
  - deployment-failure: status == failed → Critical → All channels
```
