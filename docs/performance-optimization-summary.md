- **Export Capabilities**: JSON, CSV, Prometheus formats
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and GC triggering

#### Tracked Metrics:
```javascript
{
  sparqlQueries: { total, averageTime, errorRate, cacheHitRate },
  graphProcessing: { averageSize, parseTime, errorRate },
  compliance: { violationRate, processingTime },
  system: { memoryUsage, cpuUsage, gcStats }
}
```

### 5. Streaming RDF Processing

#### Large File Support (`rdf-stream-processor.js`) 
- **Memory-Bounded Processing**: Configurable memory limits (default 100MB)
- **Adaptive Buffering**: Dynamic batch sizing based on memory pressure
- **Format Detection**: Automatic RDF format detection and parsing
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of parse errors and format issues
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time processing statistics

#### Processing Strategies:
- **Streaming**: Pure streaming for memory efficiency
- **Chunked**: Fixed-size chunk processing
- **Parallel**: Multi-worker parsing (planned)
- **Memory-Mapped**: For very large files (planned)
