- **Performance**: P95 response time < 2 seconds
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of all operations
- **Recovery Time**: < 4 hours for any outage

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
- CLI command success rate
- Template generation latency

- Health check response time

---

## 📊 MONITORING & ALERTING STRATEGY

### **Tier 1: Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)**
```yaml
# Health Check Failure
alert: service_down
condition: health_check_success_rate < 50%
severity: critical
response_time: 5 minutes
escalation: on-call engineer -> team lead -> manager

# High Error Rate  
alert: high_error_rate
condition: error_rate > 5% for 5 minutes
severity: critical
response_time: 15 minutes
escalation: on-call engineer -> team lead

# Performance Degradation
alert: performance_degraded
condition: p95_latency > 5 seconds for 10 minutes  
severity: high
response_time: 30 minutes
escalation: on-call engineer
```

### **Tier 2: Warning Alerts (Business Hours)**
```yaml
# Moderate Error Rate
alert: elevated_errors
condition: error_rate > 2% for 15 minutes
severity: warning
response_time: 2 hours

# Security Vulnerabilities
alert: security_scan_failure
condition: critical_vulnerabilities > 0
severity: high
response_time: 24 hours

# Capacity Issues  
alert: high_resource_usage
condition: cpu_usage > 80% for 30 minutes
severity: warning
response_time: 4 hours
```

### **Monitoring Dashboard Requirements**
```javascript
// Key Metrics Dashboard
const dashboardMetrics = {
  "realTime": {
    "activeUsers": "current CLI sessions",
    "operationsPerMinute": "templates generated/minute",
    "errorRate": "percentage of failed operations",
    "responseTime": "P50, P95, P99 latencies"
  },
  
  "businessMetrics": {
    "dailyActiveUsers": "unique users per day",
    "templatesGenerated": "total templates created",
    "popularTemplates": "most used generators",
    "featureUsage": "command popularity"
  },
  
  "operationalMetrics": {

### **Incident Response Playbook**
```markdown
## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection & Alert (0-5 minutes)
- [ ] Monitoring system detects anomaly
- [ ] Automatic alert sent to on-call engineer
- [ ] Initial triage and severity assessment
- [ ] Create incident ticket

### 2. Initial Response (5-30 minutes)  
- [ ] Acknowledge alert and begin investigation
- [ ] Assess impact scope and affected users
- [ ] Implement immediate workarounds if available
- [ ] Notify stakeholders based on severity

### 3. Investigation & Mitigation (30 minutes - 4 hours)
- [ ] Identify root cause using logs and metrics
- [ ] Implement temporary fixes to restore service
- [ ] Document findings and actions taken
- [ ] Monitor for improvement

### 4. Resolution & Recovery (Varies by severity)
- [ ] Implement permanent fix
- [ ] Validate full service restoration
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting if needed
- [ ] Communicate resolution to stakeholders

### 5. Post-Incident Review (Within 5 business days)
- [ ] Conduct blameless post-mortem
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Create action items for prevention
- [ ] Update runbooks and documentation
```
