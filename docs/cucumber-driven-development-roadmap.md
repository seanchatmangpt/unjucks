# Cucumber-Driven Development (CDD) Implementation Roadmap

## 🎯 CDD Philosophy: From Business Requirements to AI Agent Coordination

**Cucumber-Driven Development (CDD)** extends traditional BDD by making **behavior scenarios the primary driver** for MCP agent coordination and semantic code generation. Business stakeholders write requirements in Gherkin, and AI agents automatically collaborate to implement those requirements.

## 🚀 3-Week Implementation Roadmap

### **Week 1: Foundation - Core CDD Infrastructure**

#### **Day 1: BDD-to-Agent Mapping Setup**
**Goal**: Establish basic BDD scenario to MCP agent coordination

**Morning (4 hours)**:
```bash
# Setup enhanced vitest-cucumber with MCP integration
npm install @amiceli/vitest-cucumber@^5.2.1 n3@^1.22.4 fs-extra@^11.3.1

# Create BDD test infrastructure
mkdir -p tests/features/cdd
mkdir -p tests/support/agents
mkdir -p tests/setup
```

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
```typescript
// tests/support/agents/mcp-coordinator.ts
export class MCPCoordinator {
  async initializeFromBddScenario(scenario: BddScenario): Promise<AgentSwarm> {
    // Map BDD feature to swarm topology
    const topology = this.selectTopologyFromFeature(scenario.feature);
    
    // Initialize MCP swarm
    const swarm = await mcp_claude_flow_swarm_init({
      topology,
      maxAgents: this.calculateAgentCount(scenario),
      strategy: 'bdd-driven'
    });
    
    return swarm;
  }
  
  async spawnAgentsFromGiven(givenSteps: string[]): Promise<Agent[]> {
    // Parse Given steps to determine required agents
    const agentTypes = this.extractAgentTypesFromSteps(givenSteps);
    
    // Spawn agents in parallel using Claude Code Task tool
    return Promise.all(
      agentTypes.map(type => 
        Task(`${type} Agent`, `Handle ${type} operations for BDD scenario`, type)
      )
    );
  }
}
```

**Evening (2 hours)**:
Create first CDD scenario:
```gherkin
# tests/features/cdd/basic-semantic-generation.feature
Feature: Basic Semantic Code Generation via CDD
  As a developer writing BDD scenarios
  I want AI agents to automatically collaborate
  So that business requirements become working code

  Scenario: Generate service from business requirement
    Given I describe a "payment processing" service in natural language
    When I run the CDD workflow
    Then domain expert agents should analyze the requirement
    And code generator agents should create the service
    And the service should pass all business rule validations
```

#### **Day 2: Semantic Context Integration**
**Goal**: Connect BDD scenarios to semantic/RDF data processing

**Tasks**:
- Extend TurtleParser to work with BDD scenarios
- Create semantic context builders from Gherkin Given steps
- Implement basic semantic validation in Then steps

```typescript
// tests/support/semantic/context-builder.ts
export class SemanticContextBuilder {
  buildFromBddBackground(background: BackgroundSteps): SemanticContext {
    return background.steps.reduce((context, step) => {
      if (step.startsWith('Given I have ontology data')) {
        return this.loadOntologyFromStep(step, context);
      }
      return context;
    }, new SemanticContext());
  }
}
```

#### **Day 3: Agent Hook Integration**
**Goal**: Implement MCP agent hooks triggered by BDD step execution

**Tasks**:
- Create pre-step and post-step agent hooks
- Implement shared semantic memory across BDD scenarios
- Add performance monitoring for agent coordination

```typescript
// tests/support/hooks/bdd-agent-hooks.ts
export class BddAgentHooks {
  async beforeStep(step: BddStep): Promise<void> {
    await this.executeHook('npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task', {
      description: step.description,
      stepType: step.keyword, // Given, When, Then
      semanticContext: step.semanticData
    });
  }
  
  async afterStep(step: BddStep, result: StepResult): Promise<void> {
    if (result.success) {
      await this.executeHook('npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit', {
        memoryKey: `bdd/${step.feature}/${step.scenario}/${step.index}`,
        result: result.data
      });
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Day 4-5: First CDD Integration Test**
**Goal**: End-to-end CDD workflow with real agent coordination

**Friday Implementation**:
```gherkin
Feature: Complete CDD Workflow Validation
  
  Scenario: Enterprise microservice generation from BDD specification
    Given I have a business requirement for "user authentication service"
    And I have compliance requirements for "GDPR, SOX"
    And I have semantic context from enterprise ontology
    When I execute the CDD workflow with agent coordination
    Then domain expert agents should extract authentication requirements
    And compliance agents should validate regulatory requirements
    And code generator agents should create secure authentication APIs
    And all agents should coordinate via shared semantic memory
    And the generated code should pass all business rule validations
```

### **Week 2: Advanced CDD Capabilities**

#### **Day 6-7: Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration**
**Goal**: Complex agent coordination driven entirely by BDD scenarios

**Advanced Scenario Patterns**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Parallel microservice architecture generation
  Given I have business requirements for 5 different microservices
  And each service has different compliance requirements
  When I coordinate parallel generation across all services
  Then each service should have dedicated agent teams
  And cross-service consistency should be maintained
  And all services should integrate semantically
  
Scenario: Incremental feature addition to existing codebase
  Given I have an existing generated codebase
  And I have new business requirements for payment processing
  When I run incremental CDD workflow
  Then agents should analyze existing code structure
  And new features should integrate seamlessly
  And existing functionality should remain unchanged
```

#### **Day 8: Error Handling and Recovery**
**Goal**: Robust CDD workflows that handle failures gracefully

```gherkin
Feature: CDD Error Handling and Recovery

  Scenario: Handle invalid business requirements gracefully
    Given I have ambiguous business requirements
    When I run CDD workflow with unclear specifications
    Then clarification agents should identify ambiguities
    And the system should request requirement clarification
    And partial implementation should proceed for clear requirements
    
  Scenario: Recover from agent coordination failures
    Given I have a complex multi-agent workflow
    When one agent fails during coordination
    Then the system should isolate the failing agent
    And remaining agents should continue coordinated work
    And the workflow should complete with partial success
```

#### **Day 9: Performance Optimization**
**Goal**: Sub-second CDD workflow execution for rapid development

**Performance Targets**:
- BDD scenario parsing: <50ms
- Agent coordination setup: <200ms  
- Semantic context loading: <100ms
- Code generation: <500ms
- Total CDD workflow: <1000ms

#### **Day 10: Caching and Memory Management**
**Goal**: Intelligent caching for repeated CDD workflows

```gherkin
Scenario: Optimize repeated CDD workflows with intelligent caching
  Given I have previously executed a CDD workflow
  When I run similar business requirements
  Then agents should leverage cached analysis
  And semantic processing should use cached RDF contexts
  And code generation should reuse compatible templates
  And total execution time should be under 200ms
```

### **Week 3: Production-Ready CDD**

#### **Day 11-12: Enterprise Integration Testing**
**Goal**: CDD workflows that handle Fortune 5 complexity

**Enterprise Scale Scenarios**:
```gherkin
Feature: Fortune 5 Enterprise CDD Workflows

  Scenario: Generate complete e-commerce platform from business requirements
    Given I have comprehensive business requirements for e-commerce
    And I have 50+ microservices to coordinate
    And I have complex regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions
    When I execute enterprise-scale CDD workflow
    Then 20+ agent types should coordinate seamlessly
    And semantic consistency should be maintained across all services
    And regulatory compliance should be validated automatically
    And the system should generate 100K+ lines of production-ready code
    And total execution time should be under 10 minutes
```

#### **Day 13: CI/CD Integration**
**Goal**: CDD workflows integrated into continuous delivery

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:
```yaml

## 🎯 CDD Implementation Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Business-First Development**
```gherkin
Feature: Payment Processing
  As a customer
  I want to pay securely
  So that I can complete purchases

  # This automatically generates:
  # - Payment service with secure processing
  # - PCI-DSS compliant data handling  
  # - Integration tests for payment flows
  # - API documentation
```

### **Pattern 2: Compliance-Driven Generation**
```gherkin
Background:
  Given the system must comply with GDPR
  And the system must comply with PCI-DSS
  And the system must comply with SOX

  # This automatically ensures:
  # - Data privacy controls in generated code
  # - Audit logging for all operations
  # - Encryption for sensitive data
  # - Access control validation
```

### **Pattern 3: Performance-Aware Generation**
```gherkin
Scenario: High-performance payment processing
  Given the system must handle 100K transactions per second
  And response time must be under 100ms
  When I generate the payment service
  Then the service should use async processing
  And caching should be implemented automatically
  And load balancing should be configured
```

## 🚀 Advanced CDD Features

### **Natural Language Processing Integration**
```gherkin
# Future capability: AI-assisted scenario writing
Given I describe requirements in natural language: "We need a system that processes payments quickly and securely for our e-commerce platform"
# AI converts to structured requirements and generates appropriate BDD scenarios
```

### **Visual Scenario Builder**
- Drag-and-drop BDD scenario construction
- Real-time agent coordination visualization
- Semantic relationship mapping
- Generated code preview

### **Cross-Project CDD Coordination**
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Project Semantic Consistency
  Given I have multiple projects using CDD
  When I generate services across different projects  
  Then semantic consistency should be maintained
  And cross-project APIs should be compatible
  And shared ontologies should remain aligned
```
