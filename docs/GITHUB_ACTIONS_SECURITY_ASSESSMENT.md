## Critical Security Findings

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Missing Critical Secrets**
   - `NPM_TOKEN` required for publishing (used in 8+ workflows)
   - `SNYK_TOKEN` for vulnerability scanning
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for notifications
   - `PERFORMANCE_WEBHOOK_URL` for alerting

2. **Inconsistent Permissions Model**
   - Some workflows use excessive permissions
   - Missing least-privilege principle in 12+ workflows
   - `security-events: write` needed for SARIF uploads

3. **External Action Dependencies**
   - 45+ external actions without version pinning
   - Some actions use `@main` instead of commit SHA
   - Supply chain vulnerability exposure

### üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Incomplete Branch Protection**
   - Branch protection configured but missing some status checks
   - No signed commits requirement
   - Missing deployment protection rules

2. **Container Security Gaps**
   - Docker workflows lack comprehensive security scanning
   - Base image vulnerability scanning incomplete
   - Missing runtime security controls

3. **Audit Trail Deficiencies**
   - Inconsistent artifact retention policies
   - Missing comprehensive audit logging
   - Limited compliance reporting

## Security Configuration Analysis

### Workflow Permissions Assessment

**Properly Configured (‚úÖ)**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  actions: read
  checks: write
```

**Over-privileged Examples (‚ùå)**:
- Several workflows default to full repository permissions
- Missing granular permission scoping
- Workflow_dispatch inputs lack validation

### Secrets Management

**Required Secrets for Production**:
```yaml
secrets:
  NPM_TOKEN: "Required for package publishing"
  GITHUB_TOKEN: "Auto-provided, correctly used"
  SNYK_TOKEN: "Required for vulnerability scanning"
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: "Optional, for notifications"
  DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN: "Required for container publishing"
  SIGNING_KEY: "Required for artifact signing"
```

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ GITHUB_TOKEN properly used
- ‚ùå NPM_TOKEN missing (blocks production deployment)
- ‚ùå SNYK_TOKEN missing (reduces security effectiveness)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Other notification secrets optional but recommended
