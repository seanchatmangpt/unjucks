# Critical Issues Summary - Unjucks CLI Testing

## 🚨 Executive Summary

**Testing Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Version**: 2025.9.8  
**Overall Status**: 🔴 **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

**Key Finding**: While Unjucks has excellent architecture and UX design, **critical path resolution and module dependency issues prevent most commands from working reliably**.

## 🔴 Show-Stopping Issues

### 1. Template Discovery Completely Broken
```bash
node src/cli/index.js list
# Output: "No generators found"
```
- **Impact**: Users cannot discover what templates are available
- **Root Cause**: Template path resolution failing
- **Reality**: 28+ templates exist but aren't detected
- **User Impact**: Makes the tool essentially unusable for new users

### 2. Path Resolution Failures Across Multiple Commands
```bash
# These commands fail with path errors:
node src/cli/index.js semantic --help
node src/cli/index.js migrate --help  
node src/cli/index.js latex --help
node src/cli/index.js specify --help

# Error: Cannot find module '.../tests/latex-validation-workspace/src/cli/index.js'
```
- **Impact**: 25% of advertised commands completely broken
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect module path calculation
- **User Impact**: Advanced features inaccessible

### 3. Module Dependency Resolution Issues
```bash
# Binary execution fails:
node bin/unjucks-standalone.cjs --version
# Error: Cannot find package 'citty' 
# Error: Cannot find package 'fs-extra'
```
- **Impact**: Published binaries don't work
- **Root Cause**: Missing or incorrectly bundled dependencies
- **User Impact**: Installation doesn't provide working executable

## 🟡 Significant Issues

### 4. Export Functions Broken
```bash
echo "test" | node src/cli/index.js export --output test.md
# ERROR: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toUpperCase')
```
- **Impact**: Output generation features unusable
- **User Impact**: Can generate templates but can't export results

### 5. Multiple Binary Versions with Different Capabilities
```bash
ls bin/
# unjucks.cjs, unjucks-standalone.cjs, unjucks-safe.cjs, unjucks-optimized.cjs
```
- **Impact**: Confusion about which binary to use
- **User Impact**: No clear installation or usage path

## ✅ What Actually Works

### Core Template Generation (Partially)
- **Generate command**: Works with excellent UX
- **Error handling**: Professional error messages with suggestions
- **Interactive mode**: Good user guidance
- **Dry-run mode**: Preview capabilities work

### Example Working Commands:
```bash
# These work reliably:
node src/cli/index.js --version          # ✅ Perfect
node src/cli/index.js --help             # ✅ Excellent UX  
node src/cli/index.js generate           # ✅ Interactive mode works
node src/cli/index.js perf              # ✅ Feature-rich tools

# Template generation works with guidance:
node src/cli/index.js component react MyButton  # ✅ Shows missing variables
node src/cli/index.js api endpoint --resourceName User --apiVersion v1 --dry  # ✅ Works
```

## 🎯 Impact Assessment

### For End Users
- **New Users**: Cannot discover templates (list broken)
- **Experienced Users**: Can use core generation if they know template names
- **Enterprise Users**: Advanced features (semantic, LaTeX, migration) broken
- **Developers**: Export and automation features unreliable

### Business Impact
- **Demo Scenarios**: Tool appears broken to evaluators
- **Adoption**: Significant barrier to new user onboarding
- **Trust**: Multiple broken commands damage credibility
- **Support**: Users will report numerous "bugs" that are actually path issues

## 🔧 Fix Priority Matrix

### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix for Basic Usability)
1. **Template Discovery**: Fix `list` command path resolution
2. **Binary Dependencies**: Bundle or install dependencies properly
3. **Module Paths**: Fix path calculation in command loading

### 🟡 High Priority (Required for Full Feature Set)
1. **Export Functions**: Fix runtime errors in export commands
2. **Advanced Commands**: Fix semantic, LaTeX, migrate, specify commands
3. **Binary Consolidation**: Choose one primary binary and remove others

### 🟢 Medium Priority (Polish and UX)
1. **Cross-directory Usage**: Enable running from any directory
2. **Error Messages**: Improve clarity for path-related errors
3. **Documentation**: Update docs to reflect current working state

## 📊 Test Results Summary

| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `version` | ✅ Working | Perfect |
| `help` | ✅ Working | Excellent UX |
| `generate` | 🟡 Mostly Working | Core functionality good, discovery broken |
| `list` | ❌ Broken | Template discovery fails |
| `perf` | ✅ Working | Feature-rich |
| `export` | ❌ Broken | Runtime errors |
| `semantic` | ❌ Broken | Path resolution |
| `migrate` | ❌ Broken | Path resolution |
| `latex` | ❌ Broken | Path resolution |
| `specify` | ❌ Broken | Path resolution |
| `init` | 🟡 Unknown | Command loads, functionality untested |
| `inject` | 🟡 Unknown | Command loads, functionality untested |
| `preview` | 🟡 Partial | Command loads, limited testing |
| `new` | 🟡 Unknown | Command loads, functionality untested |
| `export-docx` | 🟡 Unknown | Command loads, functionality untested |
| `pdf` | 🟡 Unknown | Command loads, functionality untested |

**Working**: 3/16 (18.75%)  
**Broken**: 6/16 (37.5%)  
**Unknown/Partial**: 7/16 (43.75%)

## 🔮 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix template discovery** - This single fix would dramatically improve usability
2. **Fix binary dependencies** - Ensure published packages work out of the box
3. **Fix command path resolution** - Enable all advertised commands to load

### Strategic Actions
1. **Consolidate binaries** - Choose one working binary as the primary entry point
2. **Add installation verification** - Include a self-test command
3. **Improve error messages** - Help users distinguish between broken commands and usage errors

### User Communication
1. **Document current limitations** clearly
2. **Provide workarounds** for broken features
3. **Set expectations** about which commands actually work

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Unjucks has excellent potential** with well-designed architecture, good UX patterns, and comprehensive feature planning. However, **fundamental path resolution and dependency issues prevent it from being usable in practice**.

**The good news**: The core template generation system works and shows professional-quality error handling and user guidance.

**The bad news**: Basic functionality like template discovery is broken, making the tool difficult to evaluate or adopt.

**Bottom line**: Fix the path resolution issues and this could be an excellent tool. As it stands, it's not ready for production use.
