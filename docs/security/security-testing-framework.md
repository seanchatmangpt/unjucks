# Security Testing Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security testing framework for Unjucks v2025, including automated security validation, compliance testing, and enterprise-grade security assessments designed for regulated industries.

## Security Testing Architecture

### Multi-Layer Testing Strategy

```typescript
// Security testing orchestrator
export class SecurityTestingOrchestrator {
  async executeSecurityTestSuite(): Promise<SecurityTestResults> {
    const testLayers = [
      this.staticSecurityAnalysis,
      this.dynamicSecurityTesting,
      this.interactiveSecurityTesting,
      this.complianceValidation,
      this.penetrationTesting
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(
      testLayers.map(layer => layer.execute())
    );
    
    return this.consolidateResults(results);
  }
}
```

### Test Categories

#### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Automated code analysis for security vulnerabilities:

```typescript
export class StaticSecurityAnalyzer {
  async analyzeCodebase(codebase: string): Promise<SASTResults> {
    const securityRules = [
      'sql-injection-detection',
      'xss-vulnerability-scan',
      'insecure-crypto-usage',
      'hardcoded-secrets',
      'unsafe-deserialization',
      'path-traversal-risks',
      'command-injection-risks',
      'authentication-bypass',
      'authorization-flaws',
      'sensitive-data-exposure'
    ];
    
    const findings = await Promise.all(
      securityRules.map(rule => this.scanWithRule(codebase, rule))
    );
    
    return this.prioritizeFindings(findings.flat());
  }
}
```

#### 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
Runtime security vulnerability assessment:

```typescript
export class DynamicSecurityTester {
  @RuntimeSecurity
  async performDynamicScan(application: Application): Promise<DASTResults> {
    const testSuites = [
      this.authenticationTesting,
      this.authorizationTesting,
      this.inputValidationTesting,
      this.sessionManagementTesting,
      this.cryptographyTesting,
      this.errorHandlingTesting,
      this.loggingTesting
    ];
    
    const results = await this.executeParallel(testSuites, application);
    return this.analyzeResults(results);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
Combined static and dynamic analysis during runtime:

```typescript
export class InteractiveSecurityTester {
  @RealTimeAnalysis
  async monitorSecurityDuringExecution(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<IASTResults> {
    // Instrument application with security monitoring
    const instrumentation = await this.instrumentApplication(context.application);
    
    // Execute functional tests while monitoring security
    const testExecution = await this.functionalTestSuite.execute(context);
    
    // Collect security observations
    const securityObservations = await instrumentation.getSecurityFindings();
    
    return this.correlateWithFunctionalTests(testExecution, securityObservations);
  }
}
```

## Compliance Testing Framework

### Regulatory Compliance Validation

#### SOX Compliance Testing
```typescript
export class SOXComplianceValidator {
  async validateSOXCompliance(application: Application): Promise<SOXComplianceResult> {
    const tests = [
      this.validateAuditTrails,
      this.validateSegregationOfDuties,
      this.validateAccessControls,
      this.validateDataIntegrity,
      this.validateFinancialControls
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(
      tests.map(test => test.execute(application))
    );
    
    return this.generateSOXComplianceReport(results);
  }
  
  async validateAuditTrails(app: Application): Promise<AuditTrailValidation> {
    // Verify comprehensive audit logging
    const auditEvents = await app.auditService.getAuditEvents();
    
    // Check completeness
    const completeness = this.checkAuditCompleteness(auditEvents);
    
    // Check integrity
    const integrity = await this.verifyAuditIntegrity(auditEvents);
    
    // Check retention
    const retention = this.validateRetentionPolicy(auditEvents);
    
    return { completeness, integrity, retention };
  }
}
```

#### GDPR Compliance Testing
```typescript
export class GDPRComplianceValidator {
  async validateGDPRCompliance(application: Application): Promise<GDPRComplianceResult> {
    const dataSubjectRights = [
      'right-to-access',
      'right-to-rectification', 
      'right-to-erasure',
      'right-to-portability',
      'right-to-object',
      'right-to-restrict-processing'
    ];
    
    const validationResults = await Promise.all(
      dataSubjectRights.map(right => this.validateRight(application, right))
    );
    
    // Validate consent management
    const consentValidation = await this.validateConsentManagement(application);
    
    // Validate privacy by design
    const privacyByDesign = await this.validatePrivacyByDesign(application);
    
    return this.generateGDPRComplianceReport({
      dataSubjectRights: validationResults,
      consent: consentValidation,
      privacyByDesign
    });
  }
}
```

#### HIPAA Compliance Testing
```typescript
export class HIPAAComplianceValidator {
  async validateHIPAACompliance(application: Application): Promise<HIPAAComplianceResult> {
    const safeguards = {
      administrative: await this.validateAdministrativeSafeguards(application),
      physical: await this.validatePhysicalSafeguards(application),
      technical: await this.validateTechnicalSafeguards(application)
    };
    
    const phiProtection = await this.validatePHIProtection(application);
    const businessAssociates = await this.validateBusinessAssociateCompliance(application);
    const incidentResponse = await this.validateIncidentResponse(application);
    
    return this.generateHIPAAComplianceReport({
      safeguards,
      phiProtection,
      businessAssociates,
      incidentResponse
    });
  }
}
```

### Zero-Trust Architecture Validation

```typescript
export class ZeroTrustValidator {
  async validateZeroTrustImplementation(architecture: Architecture): Promise<ZeroTrustValidationResult> {
    const principles = [
      this.validateNeverTrustAlwaysVerify,
      this.validateLeastPrivilegeAccess,
      this.validateAssumeBreachMindset,
      this.validateExplicitVerification,
      this.validateMicrosegmentation
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(
      principles.map(principle => principle.validate(architecture))
    );
    
    return this.generateZeroTrustReport(results);
  }
  
  async validateNeverTrustAlwaysVerify(architecture: Architecture): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Verify all access requests are authenticated and authorized
    const accessPoints = await architecture.getAllAccessPoints();
    
    const validationResults = await Promise.all(
      accessPoints.map(async (point) => ({
        accessPoint: point,
        hasAuthentication: await this.hasAuthentication(point),
        hasAuthorization: await this.hasAuthorization(point),
        hasMultiFactorAuth: await this.hasMultiFactorAuth(point),
        hasRiskAssessment: await this.hasRiskAssessment(point)
      }))
    );
    
    const failedValidations = validationResults.filter(result => 
      !result.hasAuthentication || !result.hasAuthorization
    );
    
    return {
      passed: failedValidations.length === 0,
      details: validationResults,
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(failedValidations)
    };
  }
}
```

### Automated Test Scenarios

#### Authentication Security Tests
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication Security
  As a security engineer
  I want to validate authentication mechanisms
  So that unauthorized access is prevented

  Background:
    Given the application is deployed
    And security testing tools are configured

  Scenario: Strong Password Policy Enforcement
    When I attempt to create an account with weak password
    Then the system should reject the password
    And provide specific password requirements
    And log the failed attempt

  Scenario: Multi-Factor Authentication Requirement
    Given I have valid credentials
    When I attempt to access sensitive resources
    Then the system should require second factor authentication
    And validate the second factor
    And grant access only after successful MFA

  Scenario: Account Lockout Protection
    When I make 5 failed authentication attempts
    Then the account should be temporarily locked
    And subsequent attempts should be blocked
    And security team should be notified

  Scenario: Session Security Validation
    Given I am authenticated
    When my session expires
    Then I should be automatically logged out
    And session token should be invalidated
    And new authentication should be required
```

#### Authorization Security Tests
```gherkin
Feature: Authorization Security
  As a security engineer  
  I want to validate authorization controls
  So that users can only access permitted resources

  Scenario: Role-Based Access Control
    Given I am authenticated with "USER" role
    When I attempt to access admin functionality
    Then access should be denied
    And attempt should be logged
    And appropriate error should be returned

  Scenario: Resource-Level Authorization
    Given I am authenticated user "alice"
    When I attempt to access user "bob" profile
    Then access should be denied
    And authorization failure should be logged

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Prevention
    Given I have limited privileges
    When I attempt to modify my own permissions
    Then the modification should be rejected
    And security violation should be logged
    And security team should be alerted
```

#### Data Protection Tests
```gherkin
Feature: Data Protection Security
  As a security engineer
  I want to validate data protection mechanisms
  So that sensitive data is properly secured

  Scenario: Sensitive Data Encryption
    Given the application stores sensitive data
    When I examine the database
    Then sensitive fields should be encrypted
    And encryption should use strong algorithms
    And keys should be properly managed

  Scenario: Data Transmission Security
    When data is transmitted between services
    Then transmission should use TLS 1.3
    And certificates should be valid
    And cipher suites should be secure

  Scenario: Data Masking in Logs
    Given the application logs events
    When I examine log files
    Then sensitive data should be masked or excluded
    And PII should not be logged in plain text
    And logs should meet retention requirements
```

## Performance Security Testing

### Load Testing with Security Focus
```typescript
export class SecurityLoadTester {
  async performSecurityLoadTest(application: Application): Promise<SecurityLoadTestResults> {
    const testScenarios = [
      this.authenticatedUserLoad,
      this.privilegedUserLoad,
      this.maliciousTrafficLoad,
      this.rateLimitingTest,
      this.ddosResilienceTest
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(
      testScenarios.map(scenario => scenario.execute(application))
    );
    
    return this.analyzeSecurityUnderLoad(results);
  }
  
  async rateLimitingTest(app: Application): Promise<RateLimitTestResult> {
    const testConfig = {
      concurrentUsers: 1000,
      requestsPerSecond: 100,
      duration: '5m',
      endpoints: app.getHighValueEndpoints()
    };
    
    const loadGenerator = this.createLoadGenerator(testConfig);
    const results = await loadGenerator.execute();
    
    // Verify rate limiting effectiveness
    const rateLimitViolations = results.requests.filter(
      req => req.responseCode !== 429 && req.exceedsRateLimit
    );
    
    return {
      totalRequests: results.requests.length,
      rateLimitViolations: rateLimitViolations.length,
      effectivenessScore: this.calculateEffectiveness(results),
      recommendations: this.generateRateLimitRecommendations(results)
    };
  }
}
```

## Security Test Automation Framework

### Test Case Generation
```typescript
export class SecurityTestGenerator {
  async generateSecurityTests(application: Application): Promise<SecurityTest[]> {
    const codeAnalysis = await this.analyzeApplicationCode(application);
    const configAnalysis = await this.analyzeConfiguration(application);
    const apiAnalysis = await this.analyzeAPIEndpoints(application);
    
    const testCases = [
      ...this.generateAuthenticationTests(codeAnalysis),
      ...this.generateAuthorizationTests(codeAnalysis),
      ...this.generateInputValidationTests(apiAnalysis),
      ...this.generateConfigurationTests(configAnalysis),
      ...this.generateCryptographyTests(codeAnalysis),
      ...this.generateSessionManagementTests(codeAnalysis)
    ];
    
    return this.prioritizeTestCases(testCases);
  }
}
```

### Security Test Execution Engine
```typescript
export class SecurityTestExecutionEngine {
  async executeSecurityTestSuite(tests: SecurityTest[]): Promise<SecurityTestResults> {
    const executor = this.createParallelExecutor({
      maxConcurrency: 10,
      timeout: '30m',
      retryFailures: true
    });
    
    const results = await executor.execute(tests);
    
    // Generate detailed reports
    const detailedReport = await this.generateDetailedReport(results);
    const executiveSummary = this.generateExecutiveSummary(results);
    const complianceReport = await this.generateComplianceReport(results);
    
    return {
      testResults: results,
      detailedReport,
      executiveSummary,
      complianceReport
    };
  }
}
```

## Continuous Security Monitoring

```typescript
export class ContinuousSecurityMonitor {
  @ScheduledTest('hourly')
  async performContinuousSecurityChecks(): Promise<void> {
    const quickSecurityChecks = [
      this.validateAuthenticationEndpoints,
      this.checkForNewVulnerabilities,
      this.validateSecurityHeaders,
      this.checkTLSConfiguration,
      this.validateRateLimiting
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(
      quickSecurityChecks.map(check => check.execute())
    );
    
    const failedChecks = results.filter(result => !result.passed);
    if (failedChecks.length > 0) {
      await this.alertSecurityTeam(failedChecks);
    }
  }
}
```
