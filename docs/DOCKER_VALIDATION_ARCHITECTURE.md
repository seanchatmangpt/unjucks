- Session state persistence

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Architecture Support
```yaml
matrix:
  include:
    - platform: linux/amd64
      runner: ubuntu-latest
      arch: amd64
    - platform: linux/arm64
      runner: ubuntu-latest
      arch: arm64
```

### 2. Resource Constraint Testing
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    constraint:
      - name: minimal
        memory: 128m
        cpus: 0.25
      - name: standard
        memory: 512m
        cpus: 1.0
```

### 3. Comprehensive Security Scanning
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    scanner: [trivy, snyk, grype]
```

### 4. Production Environment Simulation
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
```

## Validation Metrics

### Security Scoring
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: -40 points each
- **High vulnerabilities**: -20 points each
- **Medium vulnerabilities**: -10 points each
- **Low vulnerabilities**: -5 points each
- **Target score**: 80+ for passing

### Performance Scoring
- **CPU benchmark**: Pass/fail based on duration thresholds
- **Memory usage**: Heap size and RSS monitoring
- **I/O operations**: Throughput and latency metrics
- **Startup time**: Application initialization speed

### Overall Validation Score
Weighted scoring system:
- Security: 30%
- Performance: 25%
- Multi-Architecture: 15%
- Production Simulation: 15%
- Coordination: 10%
- Test Matrix: 5%

## Reporting and Dashboards

### Automated Reports
- **JSON**: Machine-readable validation results
- **HTML**: Interactive dashboard with charts
- **Markdown**: Summary for PR comments
- **CSV**: Metrics data for analysis

### Dashboard Features
- Real-time validation status
- Performance trend charts
- Security vulnerability tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Test matrix status grid

## Usage

### Local Development
```bash
# Build and run validation
npm run docker:validation:build
npm run docker:validation

# Generate reports
npm run docker:validation:report
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Triggered automatically on:
# - Push to main/develop
# - Pull requests
# - Scheduled runs (nightly)
# - Manual workflow dispatch
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Individual components
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.testing -t unjucks:test .
docker run --rm unjucks:test npm run test:comprehensive

# Full validation stack
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.validation.yml up
```
