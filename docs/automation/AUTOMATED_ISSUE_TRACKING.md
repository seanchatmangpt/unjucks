## Configuration

### Workflow Triggers
All automation workflows are triggered by:
- Workflow completion events (success/failure)
- Scheduled health checks (every 6 hours)
- Manual dispatch for testing and maintenance
- Push events affecting critical dependencies

### Thresholds and Settings
- **Performance Regression Threshold**: 20% degradation from baseline
- **Security Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Quality Gate Thresholds**: Configurable per project requirements
- **Health Monitoring Frequency**: Every 6 hours with configurable periods

### Notification Configuration
Located in `.github/notification-config.json`:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "github_issue": { "enabled": true, "priority_threshold": "low" },
    "github_discussion": { "enabled": true, "priority_threshold": "medium" },
    "action_summary": { "enabled": true, "priority_threshold": "low" }
  },
  "type_mapping": {
    "ci-failure": { "assignees": ["sac"], "teams": ["ci-team"] },
    "security-vulnerability": { "assignees": ["sac"], "teams": ["security-team"] }
  }
}
```

## Issue Templates

The system uses specialized issue templates for each automation type:

- **CI/CD Failures**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/automated-ci-failure.md`
- **Performance Regressions**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/automated-performance-regression.md`
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/automated-security-vulnerability.md`
- **Quality Gate Violations**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/automated-quality-gate.md`
