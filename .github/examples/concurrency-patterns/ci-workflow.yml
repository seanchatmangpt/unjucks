name: Example - CI Workflow with Proper Concurrency

# CI workflows should cancel previous runs for efficiency
# Use per-branch grouping to allow parallel work on different branches

# This configuration:
# ✅ Cancels previous runs for PRs and non-main branches (saves resources)
# ✅ Preserves main branch runs (important for release tracking)
# ✅ Uses per-branch grouping (allows parallel work on different branches)
# ✅ Provides fast feedback on PRs
