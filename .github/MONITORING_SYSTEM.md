## 🔧 Configuration System

### Main Configuration (`config.json`)
```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "enabled": true,
    "workflows_to_monitor": ["ci.yml", "cd.yml", "test.yml"],
    "metrics": {
      "success_rate": {
        "threshold_warning": 90,
        "threshold_critical": 80
      },
      "execution_time": {
        "threshold_warning_increase": 30,
        "threshold_critical_increase": 50
      }
    },
    "alerts": {
      "slack": { "enabled": false },
      "github_issues": { "enabled": true }
    }
  }
}
```

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical Alerts**: Success rate < 80%, Duration increase > 50%
- **Warning Alerts**: Success rate 80-90%, Duration increase 30-50%
- **Healthy Status**: Success rate > 90%, Stable performance
