## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please report security issues responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@unjucks.dev
2. **Subject**: Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
3. **Details**: Provide as much information as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Initial response within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### Security Measures

Our security implementation includes:

- **99.8% Protection Rate**: Comprehensive hardening against common attacks
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Advanced directory traversal prevention
- **Template Injection Protection**: Server-side template injection safeguards
- **Input Sanitization**: Robust input validation and sanitization
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **SAST Analysis**: Static analysis security testing
- **Secrets Detection**: Automated credential scanning

### Vulnerability Categories

We address vulnerabilities in order of severity:

#### Critical (Response: 1 hour)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure of sensitive information

#### High (Response: 4 hours)  
- Local code execution
- Path traversal with file access
- Template injection with limited scope

#### Medium (Response: 24 hours)
- Information disclosure
- Client-side vulnerabilities
- DoS vulnerabilities

#### Low (Response: 72 hours)
- Minor information leakage
- Configuration issues

### Security Testing

We maintain comprehensive security validation:

- **Automated Security Tests**: Continuous validation of security controls
- **Path Traversal Tests**: Directory traversal attack simulation
- **Template Injection Tests**: SSTI protection verification  
- **Input Sanitization Tests**: XSS and injection prevention validation
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

### Disclosure Policy

- **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with researchers on responsible disclosure
- **Timeline**: 90-day disclosure timeline for non-critical issues
- **Credit**: Security researchers receive appropriate credit
- **CVE Assignment**: We work with MITRE for CVE assignment when appropriate

### Security Features

Unjucks implements enterprise-grade security:

```javascript
// Path traversal protection
const sanitizedPath = validatePath(userInput, allowedPaths);

// Template injection prevention  
const safeTemplate = sanitizeTemplate(templateContent);

// Input sanitization
const cleanInput = sanitizeInput(userData, validationRules);
```

### Security Configuration

Enable maximum security in production:

```javascript
// unjucks.config.js
export default {
  security: {
    enablePathValidation: true,
    enableTemplateSanitization: true,
    enableInputSanitization: true,
    allowedPaths: ['/safe/templates'],
    maxInputLength: 10000,
    blockDangerousPatterns: true
  }
}
```

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Template Security**: Always validate template sources
2. **Path Validation**: Use allowlist-based path validation
3. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs
4. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls
