# KGEN Self-Hosting Bootstrap Workshop

**Complete demonstration of KGEN's dogfooding capabilities**

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

This workshop demonstrates KGEN's revolutionary self-hosting capabilities where the system generates its own documentation, validates its outputs, and proves the complete dogfooding approach through recursive self-validation.

### Key Achievements

✅ **RDF Charter Modeling** - Project charter converted to comprehensive RDF graph  
✅ **SHACL Validation** - Enterprise-grade validation shapes for all data  
✅ **Self-Generation** - KGEN generates its own documentation from RDF  
✅ **Multiple Formats** - LaTeX/PDF, HTML, JSON API documentation  
✅ **Recursive Validation** - 3-level depth self-validation  
✅ **Bootstrap Proof** - Complete end-to-end demonstration

✅ Recursive self-validation completed successfully
🎉 KGEN Self-Hosting Bootstrap completed successfully!
```

### 2. Run Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
# Run validation tests
node validation/test-self-hosting.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🧪 Starting KGEN Self-Hosting Test Suite...
✅ RDF Data Exists PASSED
✅ SHACL Shapes Valid PASSED
